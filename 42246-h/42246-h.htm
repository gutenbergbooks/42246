<span class="s08">SOMETHING EXCITING</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="M" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Mother! Mother! he has a daughter!
Isn't that perfectly fine?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Penrose looked up wearily;
her head ached, and Sue was so noisy!</p>

<p>"Who has a daughter?" she asked. "Can't
you speak a little lower, Sue? Your voice
goes through my head like a needle. Who
is it that has a daughter?"</p>

<p>Sue's bright face fell for an instant, and she
swung her sunbonnet impatiently; but the
next moment she started again at full speed.</p>

<p>"The new agent for the Pashmet Mills,
Mother. Everybody is talking about it. They
are going to live at the hotel. They have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
taken the best rooms, and Mr. Binns has had
them all painted and papered,&mdash;the rooms, I
mean, of course,&mdash;and new curtains, and everything.
Her name is Clarice, and she is fifteen,
and very pretty; and he is real rich&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Very</i> rich," corrected her mother, with a
little frown of pain.</p>

<p>"Very rich," Sue went on; "and her clothes
are simply fine; and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, Mother,
isn't it elegant?"</p>

<p>"Sue, where have you been?" asked her
mother, rousing herself. (Bad English was
one of the few things that did rouse Mrs.
Penrose.) "Whom have you been talking
with, child? I am sure you never hear Mary
Hart say 'isn't it elegant'!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Mary is a schoolma'am, Mother.
But I never did say it before, and I won't
again&mdash;truly I won't. Annie Rooney told
me, and she said it, and so I didn't think.
Annie is going to be waitress at the hotel,
you know, and she's just as excited as I am
about it."</p>

<p>"Annie Rooney is not a suitable companion
for you, my daughter, and I am not interested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
in hotel gossip. Besides, my head
aches too much to talk any more."</p>

<p>"I'll go and tell Mary!" said Sue.</p>

<p>"Will you hand me my medicine before
you go, Sue?"</p>

<p>But Sue was already gone. The door
banged, and the mother sank back with a
weary, fretful sigh. Why was Sue so impetuous,
so unguided? Why was she not
thoughtful and considerate, like Mary Hart?</p>

<p>Sue whirled upstairs like a breeze, and
rushed into her own room. The room, a
pleasant, sunny one, looked as if a breeze
were blowing in it all day long. A jacket
was tossed on one chair, a dress on another.
The dressing-table was a cheerful litter of
ribbons, photographs, books, papers, and hats.
(This made it hard to find one's brush and
comb sometimes; but then, it was convenient
to have the other things where one could get
at them.) There was a writing-table, but the
squirrel lived on that; it was the best place
to put the cage, because he liked the sun.
(Sue never would have thought of moving
the table somewhere else and leaving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
space for the cage.) And the closet was entirely
full and running over. The walls were
covered with pictures of every variety, from
the Sistine Madonna down to a splendid four-in-hand
cut out of the "Graphic." Most of
them had something hanging on the frame&mdash;a
bird's nest, or a branch of barberries, or a
tangle of gray moss. Sometimes the picture
could still be seen; again, it could not, except
when the wind blew the adornment aside.
Altogether, the room looked as if some one
had a good time in it, and as if that some one
were always in a hurry; and this was the case.</p>

<p>"Shall I telephone," said Sue, "or shall I
send a pigeon? Oh, I can't stop to go out
to the dove-cote; I'll telephone."</p>

<p>She ran to the window, where there was a
curious arrangement of wires running across
the street to the opposite house. She rang a
bell and pulled a wire, and another bell jingled
in the distance. Then she took up an
object which looked like (and indeed was) the
half of a pair of opera-glasses with the glass
taken out. Holding this to her mouth, she
roared softly: "Hallo, Central! Hallo!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>There was a pause; then a voice across the
street replied in muffled tones: "Hallo! What
number?"</p>

<p>"Number five hundred and seven. Miss
Mary Hart."</p>

<p>Immediately a girl appeared at the opposite
window, holding the other barrel of the
opera-glass to her lips.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" she shouted. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, have you heard?"</p>

<p>"No. What?"</p>

<p>"Why, there 's a girl coming to live at the
hotel&mdash;coming to stay all summer! Her
father is agent of the Pashmet Mills. She
is two years older than we are. Isn't that
perfectly fine, Mary? I'm just as excited
as I can be about it. I can't stand still a
minute."</p>

<p>"So I see," said Mary Hart, who had a
round, rosy, sensible face, and quiet blue eyes.
"But do try to stand still, Sue! People don't
jump up and down when they are telephoning,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can't help it, Mary. My feet just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
seem to go of themselves. Isn't it perfectly
splendid, Mary? You don't seem to care one
bit. I'm sorry I told you, Mary Hart."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you're not!" said Mary, good-naturedly.
"But how can I tell whether it is
splendid or not, Sue, before I have seen the
girl? What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Oh! didn't I tell you? Clarice Packard.
Isn't that a perfectly lovely name? Oh,
Mary, I just can't wait to see her; can you?
It's so exciting! I thought there was never
going to be anything exciting again, and now
just see! Don't you hope she will know how
to act, and dress up, and things? I do."</p>

<p>"Suppose you come over and tell me more
about it," Mary suggested. "I must shell
the peas now, and I'll bring them out on the
door-step; then we can sit and shell them
together while you tell me."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll come right over."</p>

<p>Sue turned quickly, prepared to dash out
of the room as she had dashed into it, but
caught her foot in a loop of the wire that she
had forgotten to hang up, and fell headlong
over a chair. The chair and Sue came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
heavily against the squirrel's cage, sending
the door, which was insecurely fastened, flying
open. Before Sue could pick herself up,
Mister Cracker was out, frisking about on the
dressing-table, and dangerously near the open
window.</p>

<p>"Oh! what shall I do?" cried Sue. "That
horrid old wire! Cracker, now be good,
that's a dear fellow! Here, I know! I had
some nuts somewhere&mdash;I know I had! Wait,
Cracker, do wait!"</p>

<p>But Cracker was not inclined to wait, and
while Sue was rummaging various pockets
which she thought might contain the nuts, he
slipped quietly out of the window and scuttled
up the nearest tree, chattering triumphantly.
Sue emerged from the closet, very red
in the face, and inclined to be angry at the
ingratitude of her pet. "After all the trouble
I have had teaching him to eat all kinds of
things he didn't like!" she exclaimed. "Well,
at any rate, I sha'n't have any more eggs to
boil hard, and Katy said I couldn't have any
more, anyhow, because I cracked the saucepans
when I forgot them. And, anyhow, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
wasn't very happy, and I know I should just
hate to live in a cage, even with a whirligig&mdash;though
it must be fun at first."</p>

<p>Consoling herself in this wise, Sue flashed
down the stairs, and almost ran over her little
sister Lily, who was coming up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Susie," said Lily, "will you help me
with my dolly's dress? I have done all I
can without some one to show me, and Mamma's
head aches so she can't, and Katy is
ironing."</p>

<p>"Not now, Lily; don't you see I am in a
terrible hurry? Go and play, like a good
little girl!"</p>

<p>"But I've no one to play with, Susie," said
the child, piteously.</p>

<p>"Find some one, then, and don't bother!
Perhaps I'll show you about the dress after
dinner, if I have time."</p>

<p>Never stopping to look at the little face
clouded with disappointment, Sue ran on.
There was no cloud on her own face. She
was a vision of sunshine as she ran across
the street, her fair hair flying, her hazel eyes
shining, her brown holland dress fluttering in
the wind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>The opposite house looked pleasant and
cheerful. The door stood open, and one
could look through the long, narrow hall and
into the garden beyond, where the tall purple
phlox seemed to be nodding to the tiger-lilies
that peeped round the edge of the front
door. The door was painted green, and had
a bright brass knocker; and the broad stone
step made a delightful seat when warmed
through and through by the sun, as it was
now. The great horse-chestnut trees in front
of the house made just enough shade to keep
one's eyes from being dazzled, but not enough
to shut out the sunbeams which twinkled
down in green and gold, and made the front
dooryard almost a fairy place.</p>

<p>Mary came out, bringing a basket of peas
and a shining tin dish; she sat down, and
made room for Sue beside her with a smile.</p>

<p>"This is more satisfactory than telephoning,"
she said. "Now, Sue, take a long breath
and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Sue breathed deep, and began again the
wonderful tale:</p>

<p>"Why, I met Annie Rooney this morning,
when I went down for the mail. You remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Annie, who used to live with us?
Mamma doesn't like her much, but she was
always nice to me, and she always likes to
stop and talk when I meet her. Well! and
so she told me. They may be here any day
now, Mr. Packard and his daughter. Her
name is Clarice&mdash;oh! I told you that, didn't I?
Don't you think it 's a perfectly lovely name,
Mary? It sounds like a book, you know,
with long, golden hair, and deep, unfathomable
eyes, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never saw a book with golden hair," said
Mary, "to say nothing of unfathomable eyes."</p>

<p>"Mary, now stop teasing me! You know
perfectly well what I mean. I am sure she
must be beautiful with a name like that. Oh,
dear! I wish I had a name like that, instead of
this stupid one. Susan! I don't see how any
one could possibly be so cruel as to name
a child Susan. When I grow up, Mary, do
you know what I am going to do? I made
up my mind as soon as I heard about Clarice
Packard. I'm going to appear before the
President and ask him to change my name."</p>

<p>"Sue, what do you mean?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, it's true! It's what they do.
I've read about it somewhere. It has to be
done by act of legislature, and of course the
President tells Congress, and they see about
it. I should <i>like</i> to have that same name&mdash;Clarice.
It's the prettiest name I ever heard
of; don't you think so, Mary? But of course
I can't be a copy-cat, so I am going to have
it Faeroline&mdash;you remember that story
about Faeroline? Faeroline Medora, or else
Medora Faeroline. Which do you think
would be prettiest, Mary?"</p>

<p>"I like Sue better than either!" said Mary,
stoutly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, you do discourage me sometimes!
Well, where was I?"</p>

<p>"You had got as far as her name," said
Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Well, and her father is rich. I
should think he must be enormously rich. And
she must be beautiful,&mdash;I am quite sure she
must; and&mdash;she dresses splendidly, Annie
says; and&mdash;and they are coming to live at
the hotel; and she is fifteen&mdash;I told you
that? And&mdash;well, I suppose that is all I really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
know just yet, Mary; but I <i>feel</i> a great, <i>great</i>
deal more. I feel, somehow, that this is a very
serious event in my life, Mary. You know
how I have been longing for something exciting
to happen. Only yesterday, don't you
remember, I was saying that I didn't believe
anything would ever happen, now that we had
finished 'Ivanhoe'; and now just see!"</p>

<p>"I should think they would try to get a
house, if they are well off," said practical
Mary. "It must be horrid, living at a hotel."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, you have <i>no</i> imagination! I
think it would be perfectly delightful to stay
at a hotel. I've always just longed to; it
has been one of my dreams that some day we
might give up housekeeping and live at the
hotel; but of course we never shall."</p>

<p>"For pity's sake! I should hope not, Sue,
with a good home of your own! Why, what
would there be to like about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be so exciting! People
coming and going all the time, and bells ringing,
and looking-glasses everywhere, and&mdash;and
never knowing what one is going to have
for dinner, and all kinds of good things in little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
covered dishes, just like 'Little Kid Milk,
table appear!' Don't you remember? And&mdash;it
would be so exciting! You know I love excitement,
Mary, and I just hate to know what I
am going to have for dinner."</p>

<p>"I know I am going to have peas for dinner,"
said Mary,&mdash;"at least, I want them.
Sue, you haven't shelled a dozen peas; I shall
have to go and get Bridget to help me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I will, I truly will!" cried Sue;
and she shelled with ardor for a few minutes,
the pods flying open and the peas rattling
merrily into the tin basin.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the three peas in the
Andersen story?" she said presently. "I always
used to wish I had been one of those&mdash;the
one that grew up, you know, and made a
little garden for the sick girl. Wouldn't it
be lovely, Mary, to come up out of the ground,
and find you could grow, and put out leaves,
and then have flowers? Only, I would be
sweet peas,&mdash;not this kind,&mdash;and look so lovely,
just like sunset wings, and smell sweet for sick
people, and&mdash;Mary! Mary Hart! who is
that?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>Sue was looking down the street eagerly.
Mary looked too, and saw a carriage coming
toward them with two people in it.</p>

<p>"No one we know, I think," said Mary.</p>

<p>"They are strangers!" cried Sue, in great
excitement,&mdash;"a man and a girl. Mary Hart,
I do believe it is Mr. Packard and Clarice!
It must be. They are strangers, I tell you! I
never saw either of them in my life. And look
at her hat! Mary, <i>will</i> you look at her hat?"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> looking at it!" said Mary. "Yes,
Sue; I shouldn't wonder if you were right.
Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Indoors, so that I can stare. You wouldn't
be so rude, Mary, as to stare at her where
she can see you? You aren't going to stare
at all! Oh, Mary, what's the use of not being
<i>human</i>? You are too poky for anything. A
stranger,&mdash;and that girl, of all the world,&mdash;and
not have a good look at her? Mary, I
do find you trying sometimes. Well, I am
going. Good-by."</p>

<p>And Sue flew into the house, and flattened
herself behind the window-curtain, where she
could see without being seen. Mary was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
provoked for a moment, but her vexation
passed with the cracking of a dozen pods. It
was impossible to be long vexed with Sue.</p>

<p>As the gay carriage passed, she looked up
quietly for a moment, to meet the unwinking
stare of a pair of pale blue eyes, which seemed
to be studying her as a new species in creation.
A slender girl, with very light hair and
eyebrows, a pale skin, and a thin, set mouth&mdash;not
pretty, Mary thought, but with an "air,"
as Sue would say, and very showily dressed.
The blouse of bright changeable silk, with
numberless lace ruffles, the vast hat, like a
flower-garden and bird-shop in one, the gold
chain and lace parasol, shone strangely in
the peaceful village street.</p>

<p>Mary returned the stare with a quiet look,
then looked down at her peas again.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"What, oh, what shall we do,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>she said to herself, quoting a rhyme her father
had once made,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="o1">"What, oh, what shall we do</p>
<p>With our poor little Quicksilver Sue?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="s08">THE NEW-COMER</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_s.jpg" width="50" height="49" alt="S" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Sue Penrose went home that day
feeling, as she had said to Mary,
that something serious had happened.
The advent of a stranger, and that
stranger a girl not very far from her own and
Mary's age, was indeed a wonderful thing.
Hilton was a quiet village, and it happened
that she and Mary had few friends of their
own age. They had never felt the need of
any, being always together from babyhood.
Mary would never, it might be, feel the need;
but Sue was always a dreamer of dreams, and
always longed for something new, something
different from every-day pleasures and cares.
When the schooners came up the river, in
summer, to load with ice from Mr. Hart's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
great ice-houses, Sue always longed to go
with them when they sailed. There were
little girls on them sometimes; she had seen
them. She had gone so far as to beg Mr.
Hart to let her go as stewardess on board
the "Rosy Dawn." She felt that a voyage
on a vessel with such a name must be joy indeed.
But Mr. Hart always laughed at her
so, it would have been hard to have patience
with him if he were not so dear and good.
She longed to go away on the trains, too, or
to have the pair of cream-colored horses that
were the pride of the livery-stable&mdash;to take
them and the buckboard, and drive away,
quite away, to new places, where people
didn't have their dresses made over every
year, and where they had new things every
day in the shop-windows. Her dreams always
took her away from Hilton; for it
seemed impossible that anything new or
strange should ever come there to the sleepy
home village. She and Mary had always
made their plays out of books, and so had
plenty of excitement in that way; but Hilton
itself was asleep,&mdash;her mother said so,&mdash;and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
would never wake up. And now, all in a
moment, the scene was changed. Here, into
the very village street, had come a stranger&mdash;a
wonderful girl looking like a princess, with
jewels and gold chains and shimmering silk;
and this girl was going to lead a kind of
fairy life at a marvelous place called a hotel,
where the walls were frescoed, and you could
make up stories about them all the time you
were eating your dinner; and the dinner itself
was as different as possible from a plain
brown leg of mutton, which Katy would always
do over three times in just the same
order: first a pie, then a fricassee, then mincemeat.
Katy was so tiresome! But this girl
with the fair hair and the beautiful name
would have surprises three times a day, surprises
with silver covers,&mdash;at least, they
looked like silver,&mdash;and have four kinds of
pie to choose from. And she came from New
York! That was perhaps the most wonderful
part of all. Sue sat down on her window-seat,
gave a long sigh, and fell into a dream
of New York.</p>

<p>They drove curricles there, glittering curricles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
like those in books. (Sue was very fond
of books, provided they were "exciting.")</p>

<p>And the houses&mdash;well, she knew something
about those, of course; she had heard
them described; and of course it was stupid
to have them all alike outside, row upon row
of brownstone; but, on the other hand, perhaps
it made the mystery of the inside all the
more amazing. To go in at a plain brown
door in a plain brown house, and find&mdash;find&mdash;oh!
what would not one find? There
would be curtains of filmy lace&mdash;lace was
always filmy when it was not rich and creamy;
well, on the whole, she would have the
curtains rich and creamy, and keep the filmy
kind for something else. And the carpets
were crimson, of course, and so thick your
feet sank quite out of sight in them. ("I
don't see how you could run," Sue admitted
to herself; "but no matter.") The walls were
"hung," not papered&mdash;hung with satin and
damask, or else with Spanish leather, gilded,
like those in the Hans Andersen story. Sue
had begged piteously, when her room was
done over last year, to have it hung with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
gilded Spanish leather. She had quoted to
her mother the song the old hangings sang
after they had been there for ages and ages:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The gilding decays,</p>
<p>But hog's leather stays."</p>
</div></div>

<p>But it made no difference; the room was
papered. Sue had chosen the paper, to be
sure, and it was certainly pretty; but&mdash;she
sighed as she looked around and fancied
the Spanish leather creaking in the wind;
then sank into her dream again.</p>

<p>The rooms, downstairs, at least, were in
suites, opening out of each other in long vistas
("vista" was a lovely word! there were no
houses in Hilton big enough to have vistas, but
probably they would have them at the hotel),
with long French windows opening on to velvet
lawns&mdash; No! Sue shook herself severely.
That was the other kind of house&mdash;the kind
that was embosomed in trees, in Miss Yonge's
stories. Of course they wouldn't have
French windows in New York; the burglars
could get in. An adventure with a burglar
would be terribly exciting, though! There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
might be just one French window. Sue's
mind hovered for a moment, tempted to wander
into a dream of burglary; but she rejected
it, and went on with the house. The furniture
would be just perfectly fine&mdash;rosewood
and satinwood, and one room all ebony and
pale yellow satin. You wore a yellow crape
dress when you sat there, with&mdash;yes; now
came in the filmy lace, lots and lots of it
round your snowy neck, that rose out of it
like a dove,&mdash;no, like a swan, or a pillar, or
something. Then, upstairs&mdash;oh! she hadn't
got to upstairs yet, but she must just take a
peep and see the silver bedstead, all hung
with pale blue velvet. Oh, how lovely! And&mdash;why,
yes, it might be&mdash;in the bed there
would be a maiden sleeping, more beautiful
than the day. Her long, fair hair was spread
out on the pillow (when Sue was grown up
she was never, never going to braid her hair
at night; she was always going to spread it
out), and her nightgown was all lace, every
bit, and the sheets were fine as a cambric
handkerchief, and her eyelashes were black,
and so long that they reached half-way down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
her nose, like that paper doll Mrs. Hart made.
Well, and Sue would go up and look at her.
Oh! if she herself were only a fairy prince
in green and gold, or could change into one
just for a little while! But, anyhow, she would
look at the lovely maiden and say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Love, if thy tresses be so dark,&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>But these tresses were fair! Well, never
mind; she could change that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Love, if thy tresses be so fair,</p>
<p>How bright those hidden eyes must be!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>That was really almost as good as the real
way. It would be just lovely to be a poet,
and say that kind of thing all the time! Sue
wondered how one began to be a poet; she
thought she would try, when she got through
with this. And then the maiden would wake
up and say: "Hallo!" and Sue would say:
"Hallo! what's your name?" and she would
say, soft and low, like the wind of the western
sea:</p>

<p>"Clarice!" And then they would be friends
for life, the dearest friends in the world&mdash;except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mary, of course. But then, Mary was
different. She was the dearest girl that ever
was, but there was nothing romantic about
her. Clarice! It was a pity the other name
was Packard! It ought to have been Atherton,
or Beaudesert. Clarice Beaudesert! That was
splendid. But Mr. Packard didn't look as
if he belonged to that kind of people. Well,
then, when Clarice grew up she would have
to marry some one called Beaudesert&mdash;or
Clifford. Clarice Clifford was beautiful! And
he would be a lord, of course, because there
was the good Lord Clifford, you know. And&mdash;and&mdash;well,
anyhow, Clarice would get
up, and would thrust her tiny feet into blue
velvet slippers embroidered with pearls (if
there had really been fairies, the very first
thing Sue would have asked for would have
been small feet, instead of these great things
half a yard long), and throw round her (they
always threw things round them in books, instead
of putting them on) a&mdash;let me see&mdash;a
long robe of pale blue velvet, to match the
bed, and lined with ermine all through; and
then she would take Sue round and show her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the rest of the house. That would be perfectly
lovely! And they would tell each other
the books they liked best; and perhaps Clarice
would ask her to stay to tea, and then they
would sit down to a small round ebony table,
with a snowy cloth,&mdash;no; bare would be finer
if it was real ebony,&mdash;and glittering with crystal
and silver (they always do that), and with
rose-colored candle-shades, and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>Tinkle, tinkle! went the dinner-bell. "Oh,
dear!" said Sue. "Just as I was going to
have such a delightful feast! And it's mincemeat
day, too. I hate mincemeat day!"</p>

<p class="p2">When she was not dreaming, Sue was
planning how she could make the much-desired
acquaintance of the new-comer. Mary
advised waiting a little, and said her father was
going to call on Mr. Packard, and the meeting
might perhaps come about naturally in that
way. But this was altogether too prosaic for
Sue. She must find a way that was not just
plain being introduced; that was stupid and
grown-up. She must find a way of her own,
that should belong entirely to her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, the best thing, the right and proper
and story-book thing, would be for Mr. Packard's
horse to run away when only Clarice was
in the carriage. Then Sue could fling herself
in the path of the infuriated animal, and check
him in mid-career by the power of her eye&mdash;no;
it was lions you did that to. But, anyhow,
she could catch him by the bridle, and
hang on, and stop him that way. It didn't
sound so well, but it was more likely. Or if
Clarice should fall into the river, Sue could
plunge in and rescue her, swimming with one
hand and upholding the fainting form of the
lovely maiden with the other, till, half-unconscious
herself, the youthful heroine reached
the bank, and placed her lovely&mdash;no; said
that before!&mdash;her beauteous burden in the
arms of her distracted parent. Oh, dear, how
exciting that would be! But nobody ever did
fall into the river in Hilton, and the horses
never ran away, so it was not to be expected.
But there must be some way; there
should be!</p>

<p>So it came to pass that on the Sunday after
the Packards' arrival, Miss Clarice Packard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
rustling into her father's pew in all the conscious
glory of a flowered organdie muslin
and the biggest hat in town, found in the corner
of the pew something that made her open
her pale blue eyes wider than usual. It was
a large heart of red sugar, tied round with a
true-lover's knot of white satin ribbon. Looking
round, she became aware of a pair of eyes
fixed eagerly on her, the brightest eyes she
had ever seen. They belonged to a little girl&mdash;well,
not so very little, either; rather a tall
girl, on the whole, but evidently very young&mdash;sitting
across the aisle. This girl was ridiculously
dressed, Miss Packard thought, with no
style at all about her; and yet, somehow&mdash;well,
she was pretty, certainly. It seemed to
be one of the best pews in the church. Her
mother&mdash;that must be her mother&mdash;was "real
stylish," certainly, though her gown was too
plain; and, after all, the girl had style, too, in
her way. It would be nice to have some one
to speak to in this dreadful, poky little place
that "Puppa" would insist on bringing her to.
The idea of his not trusting her to stay alone
at the boarding-house! Clarice had wept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
tears of vexation at being "cruelly forced,"
as she said, to come with her father to Hilton.
She had called it a hole, and a desert,
and everything else that her rather scanty
vocabulary could afford. But now, here was
a pretty little girl, who looked as if she were
somebody, evidently courting her acquaintance.
There was no mistaking the eager,
imploring gaze of the clear hazel eyes. Clarice
nodded slightly, and smiled. The younger
girl flushed all over, and her face seemed to
quiver with light in a way different from anything
Clarice had ever seen. There might
be some fun here, after all, if she had a nice
little friend who would adore her, and listen
to all her stories, which the other girls were
sometimes disagreeable about.</p>

<img src="images/illus02.jpg" width="377" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"MISS CLARICE PACKARD RUSTLED INTO HER FATHER'S PEW."</p>
</div>

<p>Two people in church, that Sunday, heard
little of the excellent sermon. Sue could
not even take her usual interest in the great
east window, which was generally her mainstay
through the parts of the sermon she
could not follow. To begin with, there were
the figures that made the story; but these
were so clear and simple that they really said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
less, when once one knew the story by heart,
than some other features. There were the
eight blue scrolls that looked almost exactly
like knights' helmets; and when you looked
at them the right way, the round blue dots
underneath made the knights' eyes; and there
you had them, all ready for tournaments or
anything. Scruples of conscience obliged Sue
to have them always Templars or Knights of
Malta, and they only fought against infidels.
One of the knights had lost an eye; and the
number of ways and places in which he had
lost it was amazing: Saladin had run a lance
into it at Acre; he had been tilting, just for
fun, with Tancred, and Tancred hit him by
mistake and put his eye out; and so on and
so on. Then, there were the jewels, high up
in the window; the small, splendid spots of
ruby and violet and gold, which Sue was in
the habit of taking out and making into jewels
for her own adornment. The tiara of
rubies, the long, dangling ear-rings of crystal
set in gold, the necklace of sapphires&mdash;how
often had she worn them to heart's content!
And to-day she did, indeed, make use of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
but it was to adorn her new beauty, her new
friend. She would bring them all to Clarice!
She would put the tiara on her head, and
clasp the necklace round her slender neck,
and say, "All is yours!" And then she, Sue,
would go by dale and would go by down
with a single rose in her hair, just like Lady
Clare; but Clarice would call her back and
say: "Beloved, let us share our jewels and our
joys!"</p>

<p>Oh! Sue quivered at the thought, and
looked so brightly and earnestly at the minister
that the good old man was surprised and
pleased, and said to himself that he should
hardly have supposed his comments on Ezra
would so impress even the young and, comparatively
speaking, thoughtless!</p>

<p>When Clarice Packard came out of church,
she found her would-be acquaintance dimpling
and quivering on the door-step.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Clarice, with kind condescension,
just exactly as she had done when
Sue waked her up, in the dream!</p>

<p>"Hallo!" whispered Sue, in a rapturous
whisper. This, she told herself, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
great moment of her life. Till now she had
been a child; now she was&mdash;she did not
stop to explain what, and it might have been
difficult.</p>

<p>"Did you put this in my pew?" the new-comer
went on, secretly displaying the sugar
heart. Sue nodded, but could not trust herself
to speak.</p>

<p>"It was just perfectly sweet of you!" said
Clarice. "I'm real glad to have somebody
to speak to; I was feeling real homesick."</p>

<p>Sue was dimly conscious that it was not
good English to say "real" in that way; but
perhaps people did say it in New York; and
in any case, she could not stop to think of such
trifles. She was in a glow of delight; and
when Clarice asked her to walk down the
street with her, the cup of happiness seemed
brimming over. She, Sue Penrose, who had
never in her life been out of Hilton, except
now and then to go to Chester, the neighboring
town&mdash;she was the one chosen by this
wonderful stranger, this glittering princess
from afar, to walk with her.</p>

<p>Sue did not see Mary at first. At length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
she became aware of her, gazing in wonder,
and she gave a little quick, rapturous nod.
There was no time to explain. She could
only catch Mary's hand, in passing, and give it
a squeeze, accompanied by a look of intense,
dramatic significance. Mary would see, would
understand.</p>

<p>Of course Mary would share her treasure,
her new joy, sooner or later; but just now she
could not surrender it to any one, not even to
Mary. As Clarice passed her arm through
hers, Sue straightened her slight figure, and
looked as if the world were at her feet. And
so they passed down the street; and Mary,
left alone for the first time since she could remember,
stood in the church porch and looked
after them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="s08">MARY'S VIEW</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="m" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Mammy, I have seen her!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mary dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mammy, it isn't well! It
isn't a bit well; it 's just horrid! I don't like
her a bit, and I never shall like her, I know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hart made room beside her on the
wide sofa in the corner of which she sat knitting.
"Come and tell me, dear!" she said
comfortably. "Let us take the trouble out
and look at it; it may be smaller than you
think. Tell Mammy all about it!"</p>

<p>Mary drew a long breath, and rubbed her
head against her mother's arm. "Oh, Mammy,
you do smooth me out so!" she said. "I
feel better already; perhaps it isn't quite so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
bad as it seems to me, but I'm afraid it is.
Well, I told you how they made friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Sue put a red sugar heart in the
corner of the Packard pew, and she and the
little girl&mdash;she isn't little? well, then, the big
girl&mdash;made eyes at each other all through
the service, and fell upon each other's neck
afterward. My dear, it wasn't the thing to
do, of course; but Sue meant no harm, and it
was a truly Susannic proceeding. What came
next?"</p>

<p>"You know I was busy all day Monday,
helping you with the strawberry-jam. Well,
they were together all day; and yesterday,
when I went over to see Sue, she was at the
hotel with Clarice, and had been invited to
stay to dinner. I stayed and played with
Lily, who seemed pretty forlorn; and I kept
hoping Sue would come back; but she didn't.
Mammy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> think Lily has a forlorn time! You
spoke to me about it once, and I said then I
didn't think so. I&mdash;I think it was just that
I didn't see, then; now I do!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hart patted Mary's arm, but said nothing;
and the girl went on:</p>

<p>"Well, then, this morning, about an hour
ago, Sue came flying over in the wildest excitement.
Clarice Packard was there at her
house, and I must come over that very minute.
She was the dearest and loveliest creature in
the world; and we must love each other, too;
and we should be three hearts that beat as
one; and she never was so happy in her life!
You must have heard her, Mammy; all this
was in the front entry, and she was swinging
on the door all the time she was talking; she
hadn't time to let go the handle, she said."</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard; but I was busy, and did not
notice much. She seemed to be rather unusually
'quicksilvery,' I thought. And did you
fly over with her?"</p>

<p>"Why, no; I was just going to feed the
dogs,&mdash;I promised the boys I would, because
they wanted to go fishing early,&mdash;and I had
the chickens to see to, and I couldn't go that
minute. I oughtn't to have gone at all,
Mammy, for you needed me, though you
would say you didn't. Well, Sue went off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
quite huffy; but when I did go over, she forgot
all about it, and was all beaming and rippling.
She <i>is</i> a darling, if she does provoke
me sometimes! She flew downstairs to meet
me, and hugged me till I had no breath left,
and almost dragged me upstairs to her room.
She was out of breath as well as I, and she
could only say: 'Oh, Clarice, this is Mary!
Mary, this is Clarice Packard, my new friend.
She doesn't care a bit about being two years
older than we are! And now we shall all
three be friends, like&mdash;like the Dauntless
Three, don't you know? Oh, isn't this splendid!
Oh, I never was so happy in my life!'</p>

<p>"Mammy, Clarice Packard didn't look as if
she had ever heard of the Dauntless Three!
but she smiled a little, thin smile, and opened
her eyes at me, and said, 'So glad!' I shook
hands, of course, and her hand just flopped
into mine, all limp and froggy. I gave it a
good squeeze, and she made a face as if I had
broken her bones."</p>

<p>"You have a powerful grip, you know,
Mary! Everybody isn't used to wrestling with
boys; you probably did hurt her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>"I know, Mammy; I suppose I did squeeze
too hard. Well! Sue had been showing her
everything&mdash;all <i>our</i> things, that we play with
together. She didn't say much,&mdash;well, perhaps
she could not have said very much, for
Sue was talking all the time,&mdash;but I felt&mdash;Mammy,
I felt sure that she didn't really care
about any of them. I know she laughed at
the telephone, because I saw her.</p>

<p>"'I have a real telephone in my room at
home,' she said, 'a long-distance one. My
dearest friend lives in Brooklyn, and we have
a line all to ourselves. Puppa is one of the
directors, you know, and I told him I couldn't
have other people listening to what Leonie
and I said to each other, so he gave us a private
line.' Mammy, do you believe that? I don't!"</p>

<p>"I cannot say, my dear!" said Mrs. Hart,
cautiously. "It sounds unlikely, but I cannot
say it is not true. Go on."</p>

<p>"I think Sue had been showing Clarice her
dresses before I came, for the closet door was
open, and her pink gingham was on the bed;
and presently Clarice said: 'Have you any
jewelry?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"Sue ran and brought her box, and took out
all her pretty little things. You know what
pretty things Sue has, Mammy! You remember
the blue mosaic cross her godmother
sent her from Italy, with the white
dove on it, and the rainbow-shell necklace,
and that lovely enameled rose-leaf pin with
the pearl in the middle?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Sue has some very pretty trinkets,
simple and tasteful, as a child's should be.
Mrs. Penrose has excellent taste in all such
matters. Sue must have enjoyed showing
them to a new person."</p>

<p>"Dear Sue! she was so pleased and happy,
she never noticed; but I could see that that
girl was just laughing at the things. Of
course none of them are showy&mdash;I should
hope not!&mdash;but you would have thought they
were nothing but make-believe, the way she
looked at them. She kept saying, 'Oh, very
pretty! quite sweet!' and then she would
open her eyes wide and smile; and Sue just
quivered with delight every time she did it.
Sue thinks it is perfectly beautiful; she says
it is Clarice's soul overflowing at her eyes. <i>I</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
want to shake her every time she does it.
Well, then she said in a sort of silky voice she
has&mdash;Sue calls it 'silken,' and I call it 'silky';
and I think, somehow, Mammy, that shows
partly the way she strikes us both, don't
you?&mdash;she said in that soft, silky way,
'Any diamonds, dear?' Of course she knew
Sue had no diamonds! The idea! I never
heard anything so ridiculous. And when Sue
said no, she said: "I wish I had brought my
chain; I should like to show it to you. Puppa
thought it hardly safe for me to bring it down
here into the backwoods, he said. It goes all
round my neck, you know, and reaches down
to my belt. It cost a thousand dollars.'
Mammy, do you believe that?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it at all likely, my dear! I
am afraid Clarice is given to romancing. But
of course she may have a good deal of jewelry.
Some very rich people who have not just our
ideas about such matters often wear a great
many jewels&mdash;more than we should like to
wear, even if we had the means. But people
of good taste would never allow a young girl
to wear diamonds."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think not, Mammy! Clarice
Packard had no diamonds on, but her hands
were just covered with rings&mdash;rather cheap,
showy rings, too. There was one pretty one,
though, that took Sue's fancy greatly, and
mine too, for that matter. It was a ring of
gold wire, with a tiny gold mouse running
loose round it&mdash;just loose, Mammy, holding
on by its four little feet. Oh, such a pretty
thing! Sue was perfectly enchanted with it,
and could not give over admiring it; and at
last Clarice took it off, and put it on Sue's
finger, and said she must wear it a little while
for her sake. I wish, somehow, Sue had said
no; but she was so happy, and 'quicksilvered'
all over so, it was pretty to see her. She
threw her arms round Clarice's neck, and told
her she was a dear, beautiful, royal darling.
Then Clarice whispered something in Sue's
ear, and looked at me out of the corner of her
eye, and Sue colored and looked distressed;
and&mdash;and so I came away, Mammy dear, and
here I am!"</p>

<p>"Rather hot, and a little cross?" said Mrs.
Hart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Mammy."</p>

<p>"And with a sore spot in your heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mammy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hart put down her knitting and held
out her arms, and Mary curled up in her lap,
and tried to shorten her long legs and make
herself as small as might be.</p>

<p>"You know what I am afraid of, Mammy!"
she said.</p>

<p>Her mother nodded, and pressed the comforting
arms closer round her little girl, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am going to lose my Sue,
my own Sue, who has always belonged to
me. It doesn't seem as if I could bear it,
Mammy. It has come&mdash;so&mdash;don't you know?&mdash;so
all of a sudden! We never thought
anything could possibly come between us. I
never should think of wanting any one but
Sue, and I thought&mdash;it was the same&mdash;with
her. And&mdash;and now&mdash;she does not see herself
how it is, not a bit; she is just as sweet
and loving as ever, and she thinks that I can
start right in as she has done, and love this
girl, and that there will be three of us instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
of two. Mammy, it cannot be. You see that,
I'm sure; of course you do! And&mdash;and I
am very sad, Mammy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hart stroked the brown head in silence
for a few minutes; then she said:</p>

<p>"Dear child, I don't really think we need
be afraid of that&mdash;of your losing Sue permanently.
You are likely to have an uncomfortable
summer; that, I fear, we must expect.
But Sue is too good and loving at bottom to
be seriously moved by this new-comer; and a
tie like that between you and her, Mary, is
too strong to be easily loosed. Sue is dazzled
by the glitter and the novelty, and all the
quicksilver part of her is alive and excited.
It is like some of your stories coming true,
or it seems so to her, I have no doubt. Remember
that you are very different, you two,
and that while you are steady-going and content
with every-day life, she is always dreaming,
and longing for something new and
wonderful. She would not be so dear to you
if you were more alike, nor you to her. But
by and by the other part of her, the sensible
part, will wake up again, and she will see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
what is foolish in this new friendship, and
what is real and abiding in the old. Then,
too, Mary, you must remember that you are
excited as well as Sue, and perhaps not quite
just. You have only seen this girl once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It would be just the same, Mammy, if I had
seen her a hundred times; I know it would!"</p>

<p>"No, love; you cannot know that. Some
people show their worst side on first acquaintance,
and improve as we know them better.
You certainly must show some attention to
Clarice Packard. Your father has met Mr.
Packard, and says he seems a sensible man,
though not a person of much education.
Suppose you invite the girl here and let me
see her? We might ask her to tea some
evening this week."</p>

<p>"No, Mammy; Papa would not endure it;
I know he would not. There! look, Mammy!
There they go, she and Sue. Look and see
for yourself!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hart looked, and saw the two girls
pacing along the opposite sidewalk, arm in
arm. Clarice was bending over Sue with
an exaggerated air of confidence; her eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
languished, and she shook her head and
shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable
consequence.</p>

<p>"You are right, dear," said Mrs. Hart;
"not to tea, certainly. What shall we do,
then? Let me see! You might have a picnic,
you three girls; that is an excellent way of
improving acquaintance. You may find it
quite a different thing, meeting in an informal
way. The first interview would, of course, be
the trying one."</p>

<p>Mary brightened. "That would be just the
thing!" she said. "And I will try, Mammy,
I surely will try to like Clarice, if I possibly
can; and of course I can be nice to her, anyhow,
and I will. Oh, here comes Sue back
again, and I'll ask her!"</p>

<p>Sue came flying back along the street at a
very different pace from the mincing steps to
which she had been trying to suit her own.
Mary rapped on the window. Sue flashed an
answering smile, whirled across the street and
in at the door, hugged Mary, kissed Mrs.
Hart, and dropped on a hassock, all in one
unbroken movement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Hart," she cried, "did you see
her? Did you see Clarice? Isn't she too
perfectly lovely? Did you ever see such
hair and eyes? Did you ever see any one
walk so?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; I don't know that I ever did!"
said Mrs. Hart. "But I could hardly see
your friend's face, you know. You are very
much pleased with her, are you, Sue dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Sue, throwing her head back
with a favorite ecstatic movement of hers.
"Mrs. Hart, she is simply the most lovely
creature I ever saw in my life. Her ways&mdash;why,
you never imagined anything so&mdash;so
gracious, and&mdash;and queenly, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
I don't know what to call it. And she is going
to stay all summer; and we are to be three
together, she and Mary and I. You dear!"
She stopped to hug Mary and take breath.
"You dear old Sobriety, you haven't got a
bit used to Clarice yet; I'm only just beginning
to get used to her myself, she's so different
from us. She comes from New York,
Mrs. Hart; just think of that! She walks
down Broadway every day when she is at
home. And she has told me all about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
elevated railroad; she isn't a bit afraid to go
on it, and I don't believe I should be. And&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
Mrs. Hart, isn't it wonderful?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hart smiled down into the beaming
face; it was impossible not to respond to such
heartfelt joy.</p>

<p>"Dear Sue!" she said affectionately.
"You must bring your new friend to see
me soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I shall!" cried Sue.</p>

<p>"And Mary and I were just wondering
whether it would be pleasant for you three
to have a picnic some day soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Hart, how perfectly delightful!
When can we go? To-day? I'll run after
Clarice and tell her."</p>

<p>"No, no, Quicksilver!" said Mary, catching
Sue's skirt as she sprang up, and pulling
her down to her seat again. "We can't go to-day,
possibly. Perhaps to-morrow&mdash;what do
you say, Mammy? or would Friday be better?"</p>

<p>Sue's face fell. "Friday!" she said. "Why,
Mary, Friday is ever and ever so far off! I
don't see how we <i>can</i> wait till Friday!"</p>

<p>"To-morrow will do very well," said Mrs.
Hart. "I have a small chicken-pie that will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
be the very thing; and there are doughnuts
and cookies. How is your mother feeling,
Sue? Will she or Katy be able to get up
something for you, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, Mrs. Hart! I'll make
an angel-cake; and there is jam, and&mdash;well,
Katy was going to show me how to make
croquettes some time, and perhaps I'll learn
how to-morrow, and then they will be all
ready, you see; and oh, we'll have all
kinds of things. Let's go and see about
them now, Mary! Oh, and we'll ask the
boys. Don't you think they will come,
Mary? Clarice wants to know them. Isn't
that sweet of her?"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mrs. Hart and Mary, in
one breath. "Has she seen them?"</p>

<p>"No; but she asked if there were any nice
boys here, and of course I said yes, the nicest
boys in the world&mdash;Tom and Teddy; and she
asked me to introduce them to her; and&mdash;and
so, you see!"</p>

<p>"I see!" said Mrs. Hart, with a quiet
smile. "There are the boys now, back from
fishing. Why don't you all go and have a
good game of 'I spy' in the orchard?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, good!" cried both girls.</p>

<p>They ran to the door just in time to meet
two jolly, freckled boys who came rolling in,
both talking at once. Sue stumbled and fell
over one of them, knocking his cap off, and
his basket out of his hand.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Quicksilver," said Tom, "where
are you a-coming to? Thermometer smashed,
and mercury running all over the lot, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, Tom&mdash;I do indeed!
But I saved you the trouble of taking
off your hat, anyhow. Come along and play
'I spy' in the orchard."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried the boys. "Where's
Mammy? Oh, Mammy, pickereels! five fine
fat festive pickereels! Fried for supper, please,
Mammy! Coming, Quicksilver! All right,
Ballast!" (Ballast was Mary's nickname, as the
opposite of Quicksilver.) "Who'll count out?"</p>

<p>"I!" "Me!" "You!"</p>

<p>They tumbled out of the back door together,
and the last sound Mrs. Hart heard was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="s08">EARLY IN THE MORNING</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="50" height="49" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">At six o'clock on Thursday morning
Sue was up and scanning the clouds.
There were not many clouds to scan;
the sun was rising bright and glorious in a
wonderful blue sky.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a perfectly splendid
day!" said Sue. "I must call Mary. I don't
believe she is awake. Oh, I'll send a
pigeon; that's just what I'll do. It will be
lovely to be waked up by a pigeon this glorious
morning; and I have to feed them, anyhow,
because I said I would. I am never
going to forget the pigeons again&mdash;never!
The next time I do, I shall go without food
for two days, and see how <i>I</i> like it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>Sue dashed into her dress, buttoned it half-way
up, and rushed headlong down the stairs
and through the kitchen. Katy, the maid of
all work, was crossing the floor with a brimming
pan of milk. Crash! Sue ran directly
into her. The pan fell with a mighty splash;
the milk flew over both Katy and Sue, wetting
them from head to feet.</p>

<p>"Indade, then, Miss Sue, 'tis too bad of
yez entirely!" cried Katy. "And laughin',
too, after sp'ilin' me gown and desthroyin' me
clane flure, let alone all the milk in the house
gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Katy, if you knew how funny
you look, with the white milk all over your
red face! I can't help laughing; I truly can't.
And my dress is spoiled too, you see, so it's
all right. I can't stop now; I'm in the most
terrible hurry!"</p>

<p>She flew on, but popped her head back
through the door to say:</p>

<p>"But I am sorry, Katy; I truly am! And
if you'll just leave the milk there, I'll pick it
up&mdash;I mean wipe it up&mdash;just as soon as I
get back from the picnic."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>Her smile was so irresistible that Katy's
angry face softened in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Sure it's merely a child she is," the good
woman said. "Miss Lily's twice the sinse
of her, but yet 'tis her takes the heart of
one!"</p>

<p>She brought the mop and wiped up the milk,
then went soberly to change her dress, wondering
how the mistress would make her
breakfast without the milk-toast which was
usually all she could fancy in the morning.</p>

<p>Sue had already forgotten the milk. She
ran on across the yard, where the dew lay
thick and bright, to a small building that
stood under a spreading apple-tree. It had
been a shed once, and its general effect was
still, Sue admitted, "a little sheddy"; but the
door was very fine, being painted a light pea-green,
the panels picked out with scarlet, and
having a really splendid door-plate of bright
tin, with "S. PENROSE" in black letters.
Some white pigeons sat on the roof sunning
themselves, and they fluttered down about the
girl's head as she tried the door.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Sue. "How stupid of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
me to lock the door last night! I might have
known I should forget the key this morning.
Never mind; I can get in at the window."</p>

<p>She could, and did; but, catching her dress
on a nail, tore a long, jagged rent in the skirt.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Sue, again. "And I
don't believe there is another clean one, since
I spilt the ink last night. Never mind!"</p>

<p>Sue ran up the narrow stairs, and, crossing
a landing, entered a tiny room, papered with
gay posters. There was plenty of room for
the little table and two chairs, and if a third
person should come in she could sit on the
table. A narrow shelf ran all round the
room. This was the Museum, and held specimens
of every bird's nest in the neighboring
country (all old nests; if Sue had caught
any one robbing a nest, or stealing a new
one, it would have gone hard with that person),
and shells and fossils from the clay bank
near the river. The boys played "Prehistoric
Man" there a good deal, and sometimes
they let Sue and Mary join them, which
was great glory. Then there was smoked
glass for eclipses (Sue smoked them after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the last eclipse, a year ago, so as to be ready
for the next one; but the next one was only
the moon, which was tiresome, because you
didn't need smoked glass), and a dried rattlesnake,
and a portrait of Raphael framed in
lobster-claws. Sue did not look at these
treasures now, because she knew they were
all there; but if any "picknickle or bucknickle"
had been missing, she would have
known it in an instant. Flinging herself into
a chair, she hunted for a piece of paper; found
one, but rejected it in favor of a smooth, thin
sheet of birch bark, on which she wrote as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Juliet</span>: It is the east, and thou art the sun,
and it's time to get up. I pray thee, wake, sweet maid!
This white bird, less snowy than thy neck, bears thee my
morning greeting. Do hurry up and dress! Isn't this
day perfectly fine? Sha'n't we have a glorious picnic?
What are you going to wear? My cake is just lovely!
I burned the first one, so this isn't angel, it's buttercup,
because I had to take the yolks. Star of my night, send
back a message by the bird of love to thy adored</p>

<p class="left65">"<span class="smcap">Romeo</span>."</p>
</div>
<p>Hastily folding the note into a rather tipsy
cocked hat, Sue opened a little door upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
ladder-like staircase, and called: "Coo! coo!
coo!"</p>

<p>Down fluttered the pigeons, a dozen or
more, and taking one in her hands, she fastened
a note to a bit of ribbon that hung round
its neck.</p>

<p>"There!" she said. "Oh, you dear darlings!
I must give you your corn before I
do another thing."</p>

<p>The corn was in a little covered bin on the
landing at the head of the stairs. This landing
was called the anteroom, and was fully
as large as a small table-cloth. Sue scattered
the corn with a free hand, and the pigeons
cooed, and scrambled for it as only pigeons
can. She kept one good handful to feed the
messenger bird, and several others perched
on her shoulders and thrust their soft heads
into her hand.</p>

<p>"Dear things!" said Sue, again. "Zuleika,
do you love me? Do you, Leila and
Hassan? Oh, I wonder if I look like Lili,
in the Goethe book! If I were only tall,
and had a big white hat and a long white
gown with ruffles, I think perhaps&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped short, for a voice was calling
from below: "Sue, Sue, where are you?"</p>

<p>Sue's face, which had been as bright as
Lili's own, fell.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary Hart!" she cried. "How
could you?"</p>

<p>"How could I what?" and Mary's rosy
face looked up from the foot of the staircase.</p>

<p>"Why, I supposed you were still sound
asleep, and I was just going to send a pigeon
over. See! The note is all fastened on; and
it's a Romeo note, too; and now you have
spoiled it all!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" said Mary, cheerfully. "I'll
run right back, Sue. I am only walking in
my sleep. Look! see me walk!"</p>

<p>She stretched her arms out stiffly, and
stalked away, holding her head high and
staring straight in front of her. Sue observed
her critically.</p>

<p>"You're doing it more like Lady Macbeth
than Juliet!" she called after her. "But still
it's fine, Mary, only you ought to glare
harder, I think. Mind you stay asleep till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the pigeon comes. It's Abou Hassan the
wag" (the pigeons were named out of the
"Arabian Nights"), "so you might give him
a piece of apple, if you like, Juliet."</p>

<p>"No apples in Verona at this season!"
said Juliet, in a sleep-walking voice (which is
a loud, sepulchral monotone, calculated to
freeze the blood of the listener). "I don't
suppose hard-boiled egg would hurt him!"
Then she snored gently, and disappeared
round the corner.</p>

<p>"That was clever of Mary," said Sue. "I
wish I walked in my sleep really and truly,
like that funny book Mr. Hart has about
Sylvester Sound. It would be splendid to
be able to walk over the housetops and never
fall, and never know anything about it till you
woke up and found yourself somewhere else.
And then, in that opera Mamma told me about,
she walked right out of the window, and all
kinds of things happened. It must be dreadfully
exciting. But if I did walk in my sleep,
I would always go to bed with my best dress
on, only I'd have my feet bare and my hair
down. Dear me! There's that gray cat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
and I know she is after my pigeons! Just
wait a minute, you cat!"</p>

<p>Sue dismissed the pigeons gently, and they
fluttered obediently up to their cote, while
she ran downstairs. Sure enough, a wicked-looking
gray cat was crouching on a branch
of the apple-tree, watching with hungry eyes
the few birds that had remained on the roof.
The cat did not see Sue, or, at all events, took
no notice of her. Sue slipped round to the
farther side of the tree and began to climb
up silently. It was an easy tree to climb, and
she knew every knob and knot that was comfortable
for the foot to rest on. Soon she
was on a level with the roof of the pigeon-house,
and, peeping round the bole, saw the
lithe gray body flattened along the bough, and
the graceful, wicked-looking tail curling and vibrating
to and fro. The pretty, stupid pigeons
cooed and preened their feathers, all unconscious
of the danger; another minute, and the
fatal spring would come. Sue saw the cat
draw back a little and stiffen herself. She
sprang forward with a shout, caught the
branch, missed it&mdash;and next moment Sue and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
cat were rolling on the ground together in a
confused heap. Poor pussy (who could not
understand why she might not have pigeons
raw, when other people had them potted)
fled, yowling with terror, and never stopped
till she was under the kitchen stove, safe from
bright-eyed, shouting avalanches. Sue picked
herself up more slowly, and rubbed her head
and felt for broken bones.</p>

<p>"I <i>won</i>'t have broken anything," she said,
"and spoil the picnic. Ow! that hurts; but
I can wiggle it all right. I'll put some
witch-hazel on it. My head seems to be
a little queer!" Indeed, a large lump was
already "swellin' wisibly" on her forehead.
"Never mind!" said Sue. "I'll put arnica
on that, and vinegar and brown paper and
things; perhaps it'll be all right by breakfast-time;
and anyhow, I drove off the cat!" And
she shook herself, and went cheerfully into
the house.</p>

<p>Punctually at nine o'clock the three girls
met on the door-step of the Penrose house,
each carrying her basket. They were a
curious contrast as they stood side by side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Clarice Packard was gaily dressed in a gown
of figured challis, trimmed with rows on rows
of ribbon, and a profusion of yellow lace.
Her vast hat was tilted on one side, and her
light hair was tormented into little flat curls
that looked as if they were pinned on, though
this was not the case. She had on a brooch,
a gold chain, a locket, seven charms, five
"stick-pins," four hat-pins, three bracelets,
and eight rings; and, as Mary said to herself,
she was "a sight to behold." If Clarice, on
the other hand, had been asked to describe
Mary, she would probably have called her a
red-faced dowdy. As a rule, people did not
think Mary Hart pretty; but every one said,
"What a <i>nice</i>-looking girl!" And, indeed,
Mary was as pleasant to look at as clear red
and white&mdash;and freckles!&mdash;could make her,
with the addition of a very sweet smile, and
a pair of clear, honest, sensible blue eyes.
Her brown holland frock was made in one
piece, like a child's pinafore, and, worn with a
belt of russet leather, made a costume of such
perfect comfort that she and Sue had vowed
to keep to it till they were sixteen, if their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
mothers would let them. Sue was not in
brown holland to-day, because she had torn
her last clean pinafore dress, as we have seen;
but the blue gingham sailor-suit did well
enough, and the blouse was very convenient
to put apples in, or anything else from a tame
squirrel to a bird's nest. Just now it held a
cocoanut and some bananas that would not
go into the basket, and that gave the light, fly-away
figure a singular look indeed.</p>

<p>But Sue's bright face was clouded just
now. She stood irresolute, swinging her
basket, and looking from one to the other
of her companions.</p>

<p>"Mother says we must take Lily!" she
announced in a discontented tone. "I don't
see how we can be bothered with having her.
She'll want to know everything we are talking
about, and we sha'n't have half so much fun."</p>

<p>Clarice looked sympathetic. "Children
are such a nuisance!" she said, and shrugged
her shoulders. "Seems to me they ought to
know when they are not wanted."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Sue!" said Mary, ignoring the
last speech. "Of course we will take Lily;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
she'll be no trouble at all, and she will help a
good deal with the wreaths and baskets. I'll
see to her," she added, a little pang of bitterness
mingling with one of self-reproach. She
had not always wanted to take Lily when she
and Sue were together. They always had so
much to say to each other that was extremely
important, and that no one else could possibly
understand, that a third in the party, and that
third a child of nine, seemed sadly in the way.
Now, however, all was changed. Somehow,
it was herself who was the third. Perhaps
Lily's presence would be a relief to-day.</p>

<p>Presently the little girl came running out,
all beaming with delight at being allowed to
go on the big girls' picnic.</p>

<p>"Mother has given me a whole bottle of
raspberry shrub!" she announced joyfully.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Sue, her face brightening
again. "We can have toasts, and that will
be splendid. Now let's start, girls! Come,
Clarice. Let me carry your basket; it's heavy,
and I can carry two just as well as one."</p>

<p>"Start!" echoed Clarice. "We are not
going to walk, are we?"

<p class="caption">ON THE WAY TO THE PICNIC.</p>
</div>

<p>"Why, yes," said Sue, looking a little
blank. "Don't you&mdash;aren't you fond of
walking, Clarice? We always walk, Mary
and I."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly; I adore walking. Only, if I
had known, Puppa would have sent the team
for us. Is it far?" And Clarice glanced down
at her shoes, with their paper soles and high
heels.</p>

<p>"No," said Sue, cheerily. "Only a little
bit of a way, not more than a mile. Oh, Clarice,
what a lovely brooch that is! Won't you
tell me about it as we go along? I am sure
there is a story about it; there's something
so exciting about all your things. Do tell
me."</p>

<p>Clarice simpered and cast down her eyes,
then cast a significant glance at the others.
She took Sue's arm, and they walked on together,
one listening eagerly, the other evidently
pouring out some romantic story.
Mary took Lily's hand in hers.</p>

<p>"Come, Lily," she said; "we will go together,
and I'll tell you a story as we go.
What one would you like? 'Goosey, Gobble,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and Ganderee'? Very well!" But to herself
Mary was saying: "I don't believe that girl
ever walked a mile in her life. We shall
have to carry her before we get to the
Glen!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="s08">THE PICNIC</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_c.jpg" width="50" height="51" alt="C" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Clarice Packard was indeed
in rather a sad plight before they
reached the Glen. Part of the
road was sandy, and her high heels sank into
the sand and made it hard walking for her,
while her companions, in their broad-soled
"sneakers," trod lightly and sturdily. Then,
too, she had from time to time a stitch in her
side, which forced her to sit down and rest for
some minutes. Mary, looking at her tiny,
wasp-like waist, thought it was no wonder.
"Her belt is too tight," she whispered to Sue.
"Of course she can't walk. Tell her to let it
out two or three holes, and she will be all
right."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Mary," whispered Sue. "It
isn't that at all; it's only that she is so delicate.
I ought never to have brought her all
this way. She has been telling me about the
fainting-fits she has sometimes. Oh, what
should we do if she had one now!"</p>

<p>"Pour some water over her," said downright
Mary. "But don't worry, Sue; we are
nearly there, and it really <i>cannot</i> hurt her to
walk one short mile, you know."</p>

<p>"Do you think not, Mary? But I am
afraid you don't understand her. You see,
she is so delicate, and you are as strong as a
cart-horse. Clarice said so. And I suppose I
am pretty strong, too."</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged to her," said Mary.
"Come, Sue, let's push along; she will be all
right when we once get there and she has
rested a little."</p>

<p>The Glen was indeed a pleasant place. A
clear stream ran along between high, rocky
banks, with a green space on one side, partly
shaded by two or three broad oak-trees.
Under one of these trees was a bank of moss,
as soft and green as if it had been piled by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
the fairies for their queen. Indeed, this was
one of Sue's and Mary's theories, the other
being that this special oak was none other
than Robin Hood's own greenwood tree,
transplanted by magic from the depths of
Sherwood Forest. The former theory appealed
more to Sue now, as she led the weary
Clarice to the bank, and made her sit down
in the most comfortable place.</p>

<p>"There, dear," she cried; "isn't this
lovely? You shall rest here, Clarice, and we
will play fairies, and you shall be Titania.
You don't mind, do you, Mary, if Clarice is
Titania this time? She is so slender, you
see, and light; and besides, she is too tired to
be anything else."</p>

<p>Mary nodded, with a smile; she could not
trust herself to speak. She had been Titania
ever since they first read "Lamb's Tales"; but
it was no matter, and she had promised her
mother to do her very best to bring Clarice
out, and learn the better side of her.</p>

<p>"Isn't it lovely, Clarice?" she asked, repeating
Sue's question as she took her place
on the mossy bank.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"Alegant!" was the languid reply; "perfectly
alegant. Isn't it damp, though?
Doesn't it come off green on your clothes?"</p>

<p>Mary reassured her on this point. She examined
her challis anxiously, and sank back
again, apparently relieved. She looked round
her. Sue and Lily had vanished for the moment.
The trees met over their heads. There
was no sound save the tinkling of the brook
and the faint rustle of the leaves overhead.</p>

<p>"It's real lonesome, isn't it?" said Clarice.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary; "that's part of the beauty
of it. There is never any one here, and we
can do just as we like, with no fear of any one
coming. I think in the woods it's pleasant
to be alone, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Alegant!" said Clarice; "perfectly alegant!
Are there any more people coming,
did you say?"</p>

<p>"Only my brothers; they are coming
later."</p>

<p>Clarice brightened, and sat up, arranging
her trinkets. "Are they in college?" she
asked, with more interest than she had shown
in anything that day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Mary, laughing. "They
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this moment Sue came running up
with an armful of ferns and oak-leaves, Lily
following with another load. "I had to go
a long way before I found any that were
low enough to reach!" cried Sue, panting
after her run. "I mustn't shin to-day, 'cause
these are new stockings, and last time I tore
them all to pieces."</p>

<p>"Tore these all to pieces?" asked Mary,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Be still, Mary; I won't be quirked at.
Now let's all make garlands. No, not you,
Clarice; you must just rest. Do you feel
better? Do you think you'll be all right in
a little while? Now you shall be Titania and
give us orders and things; and then, when we
have finished the wreaths, we'll sing you to
sleep. I am Oberon, you know, generally;
but I'll be one of the common fairies now;
and Lily&mdash;yes, Lily, you can be Puck. Now,
can you say some of it, Clarice?"</p>

<p>"Some of what?" asked Clarice, with an
uncomprehending look.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, 'Midsummer-Night's Dream.' We
always play that here, except when we play
Robin Hood. Perhaps you would rather play
Robin, Clarice; perhaps you don't care for
'Midsummer-Night's Dream.' Oh, I hope you
do, though. We are <i>so</i> fond of it, Mary and I!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Clarice,
rather peevishly. "Oh, Shakspere's play?
I never read it. I didn't take literature at
school. Puppa thought I was too delicate to
study much."</p>

<p>Sue looked blank for a moment. Not to
know "Midsummer-Night's Dream"&mdash;that
did seem very strange!</p>

<p>But Clarice opened her eyes at her and
smiled and sighed. "My eyes have never
been strong!" she murmured plaintively.</p>

<p>Sue's arms were round her in an instant.
"You poor darling!" she cried. "Isn't that
hard, Mary? isn't it cruel? To think of not
having strong eyes! Clarice, I will come and
read to you every day; I should just love to
do it. We'll begin to-morrow morning. Oh,
how splendid that will be! What shall we
read first? You have read 'Westward Ho!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of course, and all Mrs. Ewing, and 'Prince
Prigio,' and 'The Gentle Heritage,' and the
Alices, and all the Waverleys?"</p>

<p>No; Clarice had read none of these. She
had read "Wilful Pansy, the Bride of an
Hour," she said, last; and she had just begun
"My Petite Pet" before she came here. It
was perfectly sweet, and so was another by
the same author, only she couldn't remember
the name.</p>

<p>"Aren't we going to play something?"
asked Lily, plaintively. Lily could never understand
why big girls spent so much good
time in talking.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried Sue. "We must play,
to get up an appetite for dinner; I've got
one already, but I'll get another. What
would you like to play, Clarice?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Clarice. "Anything
you like."</p>

<p>"Oh, but do care, please!" cried Sue, imploringly;
"because this is your picnic, really.
We got it up for you; and we want you to
have everything just as you like it; don't
we, Mary?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>Mary assented civilly, and pressed Clarice
to choose a game.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I really don't care in the least!"
said Clarice. "I don't know much about
games; my set of girls don't play them; but
I'll play anything you like, dear!" She
opened her eyes and smiled again, and again
Sue embraced her ardently.</p>

<p>"You dear, sweet, unselfish thing!" she
cried. "I think you are an angel; isn't she,
Mary? Perhaps we needn't play anything,
after all. What <i>would</i> you like to do, Clarice?"</p>

<p>But Clarice would not hear of this&mdash;would
not choose anything, but would graciously
play any game they decided on. A game of
"Plunder" was started, but somehow it did
not go well. Plunder is a lively game, and
must be played with ardor. After two or
three runs, Clarice put her hand to her side
and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"Only a stitch!" she murmured; and she
sank down on the mossy bank, while the
others gathered round her with anxious
faces.</p>

<p>"It will go off in a minute. I'm afraid I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
am not strong enough to play this any more,
girls. Rough games never suit me."</p>

<p>Mary flushed and looked at Sue; but Sue's
gaze was fixed on Clarice, all contrition. "My
dear! I am so sorry! You see, we've never
been delicate, and we don't know how; we
don't even know what it's like. Lie down,
dear, and rest again! Oh, Mary, I feel as if
we were murderers. See how white she is!
Do you think she is going to die?"</p>

<p>This was more than Mary could stand. "I
think you would be better, Clarice," she said
bluntly, "if you loosened your dress a little.
Sha'n't I let out your belt for you?"</p>

<p>But Clarice cried out, and declared her
dress was too loose already. "I never wear
anything tight," she said&mdash;"never! See, I
can put my whole hand up under my belt."
And so she could, when she drew her breath
in. "No," she said; "it is my heart, I fear.
I suppose I shall never be strong like some
people. But don't mind me! Go on playing,
and I will watch you."</p>

<p>But three were not enough for Plunder;
and besides, the heart for playing seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
be gone out of them all, except Lily, who
pouted and hung her head, and thought this
a very poor kind of picnic indeed. Clarice
lay on the bank and fanned herself, looking
utterly bored, as indeed she was. Sue regarded
her with wide, remorseful eyes, and
wondered what she ought to do. In desperation,
Mary proposed lunch.</p>

<p>"I am getting hungry!" she said. "Aren't
you, girls? It will take a little time to get
the things out and trim the table; let's begin
now."</p>

<p>All agreed with alacrity, and there was
some animation as the baskets were unpacked
and their contents spread on the
"table," which was green and smooth, and
had no legs. The platters were made of oak-leaves
neatly plaited together. The chicken-pie
was set out, the cakes and turnovers beside
it, with doughnuts and sandwiches at
convenient intervals. Sue tumbled the bananas
and the cocoanut out of her blouse,
and piled them in an artistic pyramid, tucking
in fern-fronds and oak-leaves.</p>

<p>"There!" she said, surveying the effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
with her head on one side. "That is pretty,
isn't it, Mary&mdash;I mean Clarice?"</p>

<p>Mary pressed her lips together and
squeezed Lily's hand hard. Clarice said it
was "perfectly alegant," and then asked again
if the gentlemen were coming.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" said Sue. "Oh, how funny
you are, Clarice! Mary, isn't she funny?
The idea of calling the boys gentlemen!"</p>

<p>"I hope they are!" was on the tip of Mary's
tongue; but she refrained, and only said it
was time they were here. As if in answer to
her words, a joyous whoop was heard, and a
scuttling among the branches. Next moment
Tom and Teddy burst into the open, out of
breath, as usual, tumbling over each other
and over their words in their eagerness.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Hallo, Quicksilver! Are we late?"</p>

<p>"I say! we stopped to get some apples.
Did you remember apples? I knew you
wouldn't, so we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we found a woodchuck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Mary, you should have seen
him! He sat up in the door of his hole,
and&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>"Salt! you forgot the salt, Ballast, and
Mammy sent it. Saccarappa! it's all spilled
into my pocket. Do you mind a few crumbs?"</p>

<p>"Boys! boys!" said Mary, who had been
trying in vain to make herself heard, "do be
quiet! I want to introduce you to Miss Packard.
Clarice, these are my brothers, Tom
and Teddy."</p>

<p>The boys had no hats to take off,&mdash;they
wore hats on Sunday, though!&mdash;but they
bowed with the short, decisive duck of fourteen
(indeed, Tom was fifteen, but he did not
look it), and tried to compose their features.
"Do!" they murmured; then, at a severe look
from Mary, they came forward, and each
extended a grimy paw and shook Clarice's
gloved hand solemnly, leaving marks on it.
The ceremony over, they breathed again, and
dropped on the grass.</p>

<p>"Isn't this jolly?" they cried. "Ready
for grub? We are half starved."</p>

<p>Clarice's look was almost tragic as she
turned upon Sue. "Are these the boys you
meant?" she asked in a whisper that was
fully audible. "These&mdash;little&mdash;ragamuffins?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illus04" id="illus04"></a>
<img src="images/illus04.jpg" width="361" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"EACH CAME FORWARD AND SHOOK CLARICE'S GLOVED HAND
SOLEMNLY."</p>
</div>

<p>Fortunately, Mary was talking to Teddy,
and did not hear. Sue did, and for the first
time her admiration for Clarice received a
shock. She raised her head and looked full
at Clarice, her hazel eyes full of fire. "I don't
understand you," she said. "These are my
friends; I invited them because you asked
me to."</p>

<p>Clarice's eyes fell; she colored, and muttered
something, Sue did not hear what; then she
put her hand to her side and drew a short,
gasping breath.</p>

<p>In an instant Sue's anger was gone.
"Boys!" she cried hastily. "Tom, bring some
water, quick! She's going to faint."</p>

<p>Clarice was now leaning back with closed
eyes. "Never mind me," she murmured
softly; "go on and enjoy yourselves. I shall
be&mdash;better&mdash;soon, I dare say."</p>

<p>Splash! came a shower of water in her face.
Tom, in eager haste, had stumbled over Sue's
foot, and his whole dipperful of water was
spilled over the fainting maiden. She sprang
to her feet with amazing agility.</p>

<p>"You stupid, stupid boy!" she cried, stamping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
her foot, her eyes blazing with fury.
"You did it on purpose; you know you did!
Get away this minute!"</p>

<p>Then, while all looked on in silent amaze,
she burst into tears, and declared she would
go home that instant. She would not stay
there to be made a fool of by odious, rude,
vulgar boys.</p>

<p>There was dead silence for a moment. Then
Tom said, slowly and solemnly (no one could
be so solemn as Tom when he tried): "I beg
your pardon, Miss Packard; I am very sorry.
I will go away if you wish it, but I hope you
will stay."</p>

<p>Sue wanted to hug Tom, but refrained.
(She had decided a little while ago that she
was getting too big to hug the boys any more.)
"Tom, you are a darling," she whispered in
his ear&mdash;"a perfect dear duck! And you
can use the telephone all you like to-morrow.
Clarice," she added aloud, "he has apologized;
Tom has apologized, and that is all
he can do, isn't it? You are all right now,
aren't you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>Clarice hesitated. Her dignity was on the
one hand, her dinner on the other; she was
hungry, and she yielded.</p>

<p>"If he didn't really mean to," she began
ungraciously; but Mary cut her short with
what the boys called her full-stop manner.</p>

<p>"I think there has been quite enough of
this foolishness," she said curtly. "Sue, will
you pass the sandwiches? Have some chicken-pie,
Clarice!"</p>

<p>A sage has said that food stops sorrow,
and so it proved in this case. The chicken-pie
was good, and all the children felt wonderfully
better after the second help all round.
Tongues were loosed, and chattered merrily.
The boys related with many chuckles their
chase of the woodchuck, and how he finally
escaped them, and they heard him laughing
as he scuttled off.</p>

<p>"Well, he <i>was</i> laughing&mdash;woodchuck
laughter; you ought just to have heard him,
Mary."</p>

<p>Sue made them all laugh by telling of her
encounter with Katy and the milk-pan. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Clarice warmed up after her second glass of
shrub, and told them of the picnics they had
at Saratoga, where she had been last year.</p>

<p>"That was why I was so surprised at this
kind of picnic, dear," she said to Sue, with a
patronizing air. "It's so different, you see.
The last one I went to, there were&mdash;oh, there
must have been sixty people at the very least.
It was perfectly alegant! There were two
four-in-hands, and lots of drags and tandems.
I went in a dog-cart with Fred. You know&mdash;the
one I told you about." She nodded mysteriously
and simpered, and Sue flushed with
delighted consequence.</p>

<p>"What did you take?" asked Lily, her
mouth full of chicken.</p>

<p>"Oh, a caterer furnished the refreshments,"
said Clarice, airily. "There was everything
you can think of: salads, and ice-cream, and
boned turkey, and all those things. Perfectly
fine, it was! Everybody ate till they couldn't
hardly move; it was alegant!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you do anything but just gob&mdash;I
mean eat?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh, there was a band of music, of course;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
and we walked about some, and looked at
the dresses. They were perfectly alegant! I
wore a changeable taffeta, blue and red, and a
red hat with blue birds in it. Everybody said
it was just as cute! The reporter for the 'Morning
Howl' was there, and he said it was the
handsomest costume at the picnic. He was
a perfect gentleman, and everything I had on
was in the paper next day."</p>

<p>"This is soul-stirring," said Tom (who did
sometimes show that he was fifteen, though
not often), "but didn't I hear something about
toasts?"</p>

<p>Clarice looked vexed, but Mary took up
the word eagerly. "Yes, to be sure, Tom;
it is quite time for toasts. Fill the glasses
again, Teddy! Clarice, you are the guest of
honor; will you give the first toast?"</p>

<p>Clarice shook her head, and muttered something
about not caring for games.</p>

<p>"Then I will!" cried Sue; and she stood
up, her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"I drink to Clarice!" she said. "I hope
she will grow strong, and never have any
heart again,&mdash;I mean any pain in it,&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
that she will stay here a long, long time, till
she grows up!"</p>

<p>Teddy choked over his glass, but the others
said "Clarice!" rather soberly, and clinked
their glasses together. Clarice, called upon
for a speech in response to the toast, simpered,
and said that Sue was too perfectly sweet for
anything, but could think of nothing more.
Then Tom was called upon. He rose slowly,
and lifted his glass.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I drink to the health of Quicksilver Sue!</p>
<p>May she shun the false, and seek the true!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Mary gave him a warning glance, but Sue
was enchanted. "Oh, Tom, how dear of
you to make it in poetry!" she cried, flushing
with pleasure. "Wait; wait just a minute,
and I'll make my speech."</p>

<p>She stood silent, holding up her glass, in
which the sunbeams sparkled, turning the
liquid to molten rubies; then she said rather
shyly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I drink to Tom, the manly Hart,</p>
<p>And wish him all the poet's art!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>This was received with great applause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>Mary's turn came next; but before she could
speak, Clarice had sprung to her feet with a
wild shriek. "A snake!" she cried; "a
snake! I saw it! It ran close by my foot.
Oh, I shall faint!"</p>

<p>Teddy clapped his hand to his pocket, and
looked shamefaced.</p>

<p>"I thought I had buttoned him in safe," he
said. "I'm awfully sorry. The other one is
in there all right; it was only the little one
that got out."</p>

<p>But this was too much for Clarice. She
declared that she must go home that instant;
and after an outcry from Sue no one opposed
her. The baskets were collected, the crumbs
scattered for the birds, and the party started
for home. Mary and her brothers led the
way with Lily, Sue and Clarice following
slowly behind with arms intertwined. Sue's
face was a study of puzzled regret, self-reproach,
and affection.</p>

<p>"Mary," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Hush, Tom!" said Mary, with a glance
over her shoulder. "Don't say anything till
we get home."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not going to say anything. But
what famous book&mdash;the name of it, I mean&mdash;expresses
what has been the matter with
this picnic?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, Tom. 'Much Ado
about Nothing'?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tom. "It's 'Ben Hur'!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="s08">AT THE HOTEL</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Oh Clarice, isn't it too bad that it's
raining?" said Sue. "It hadn't
begun when I started. It did look
a little threatening, though. And I meant to
take you such a lovely walk, Clarice. I don't
suppose you want to go in the rain? I love
to walk in the rain, it's such fun; but you are
so delicate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Clarice, ignoring the
wistful tone in Sue's voice. "I shouldn't
dare to, Sue. There is consumption in my
family, you know,"&mdash;she coughed slightly,&mdash;"and
it always gives me bronchitis to go out
in the rain. Besides, I have such a headache!
Have some candy? I'll show you
my new dresses, if you like. They just came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
this morning from New York&mdash;those muslins
I told you about."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be fun!" said Sue. But as
she took off her tam-o'-shanter she gave a
little sigh, and glanced out of the window.
The rain was coming down merrily. It was
the first they had had for several weeks, and
sight, sound, and smell were alike delightful.
It would be such fun to tramp about and
splash in the puddles and get all sopping!
Last summer, when the drought broke, she
and Mary put on their bathing-dresses, and
capered about on the lawn and played "deluge,"
and had a glorious time. But of course
she was only twelve then, and now she was
thirteen; and it made all the difference in the
world, Clarice said. The water was coming
in a perfect torrent from that spout! If you
should hold your umbrella under it, it would
go f-z-z-z-z-z! and fly "every which way";
that was centrifugal force, or something&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here they are," said Clarice.</p>

<p>Sue came back with a start, and became all
eyes for the muslin dresses which were spread
on the bed. They were too showy for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
young girl, and the trimmings were cheap
and tawdry; but the colors were fresh and
gay, and Sue admired them heartily.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clarice, how lovely you will look in
this one!" she cried. "Don't you want to
try it on now, and let me see you in it?"</p>

<p>Clarice asked nothing better, and in a few
minutes she was arrayed in the yellow muslin
with blue cornflowers. But now came a difficulty:
the gown would not meet in the back.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a shame!" said Sue. "Will
you have to send it back, Clarice, or can you
have it altered here? There is a very good
dressmaker; she makes all our clothes,&mdash;Mary's
and mine,&mdash;except what are made at
home."</p>

<p>Clarice tittered.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she wouldn't be quite my
style," she said. "I wondered where your
clothes <i>were</i> made, you poor child! But this
is all right. I'll just take in my stays a little,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, Clarice! Please don't! I am
sure it will hurt you. Why, that would be
tight lacing, and tight lacing does dreadful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
things to you. I learned about it at school.
Dear Clarice, don't do it, please!"</p>

<p>"Little goose! who said anything about
tight lacing? I'm only going to&mdash;there!
Now look&mdash;I can put my whole hand in. You
mustn't be so awfully countrified, Sue. You
can't expect every one to go about in a bag,
as you and Mary Hart do. I am two years
older than you, my dear, and I haven't lived
in a village all my life. It is likely that I know
quite as much about such matters as you do."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Clarice!" said
Sue, the quick tears starting to her eyes.
"Of course you know a great, great deal
more than I do; I&mdash;I only thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, do you see?" Clarice went on.
"Now, that is real comfortable&mdash;perfectly
comfortable; and it does fit alegant, don't it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly makes you look very slender,"
faltered Sue.</p>

<p>"Don't it?" repeated Clarice. "That's
what my dressmaker always says."</p>

<p>She was turning slowly round and round
before the glass, enjoying the effect. "There
is nothing like a slender figure, she says;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
and I think so, too. Why, Sue, if you'll
promise never to tell a soul, I'll tell you
something. I used to be fat when I was your
age&mdash;almost as fat as Mary Hart. Just think
of it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, did you? But Mary isn't really fat,
Clarice. She's only&mdash;well, rather square,
you know, and chunky. That is the way she
is made; she has always been like that."</p>

<p>"I call her fat!" said Clarice, decisively.
"Of course, it's partly the way she dresses,
with no waist at all, and the same size all the
way down. You would be just as bad, Sue,
if you weren't so slim. I don't see what possesses
you to dress the way you do, making
regular guys of yourselves. But I was going
to tell you. My dressmaker&mdash;she's an alegant
fitter, and a perfect lady&mdash;told me to
eat pickled limes all I could, and put lots of
vinegar on everything, and I would get thin.
My! I should think I did. I used to eat six
pickled limes every day in recess. I got so
that I couldn't hardly eat anything but what
it had vinegar in it. And I fell right away,
in a few months, to what I am now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, Clarice!" cried Sue, transfixed
with horror. "How could you? Why, it must
have made you ill; I know it must. Is that
why you are so pale?"</p>

<p>"Partly that," said Clarice, complacently.
"Partly, I used to eat slate-pencils. I haven't
had hardly any appetite for common food this
year. The worst is these headaches I have
right along. But I don't care! I should hate
to have staring red cheeks like Mary Hart.
Your color is different; it's soft, and it comes
and goes. But Mary Hart is dreadful beefy-looking."</p>

<p>"Clarice," said Sue, bravely, though she
quivered with pain at the risk of offending
her new friend, "please don't speak so of
Mary. She is my oldest friend, you know,
and I love her dearly. Of course I know you
don't mean to say anything unkind, but&mdash;but
I'd rather you didn't, please."</p>

<p>"Why, I'm not saying anything against
her character!" said Clarice; and any one
save Sue might have detected a spiteful ring
in her voice. "I won't say a word about her
if you'd rather not, Sue, but if I do speak, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
must say what I think. She's just as jealous
of me as she can be, and she tries to make
trouble between us&mdash;any one can see that;
and I don't care for her one bit, so there!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clarice, don't say that! I thought we
were all going to be friends together, and
love one another, and&mdash; But you don't really
know Mary yet. She is a dear; really and
truly she is."</p>

<p>Clarice tossed her head significantly. "Oh,
<i>I</i> don't want to make mischief!" she said.
"Of course it doesn't matter to <i>me</i>, my dear.
Of course I am only a stranger, Sue, and I
can't expect you to care for me half as much
as you do for Mary Hart. Of course I am
nobody beside her."</p>

<p>"Clarice, Clarice, how can you? Don't
talk so. It <i>kills</i> me to have you talk so!
when you know how I love you, how I would
do anything in the wide world for you, my
dear, lovely Clarice!"</p>

<p>Clarice pouted for some time, but finally
submitted to be embraced and wept over, and
presently became gracious once more, and
said that all should be forgiven (she did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
explain what there was to forgive), and only
stipulated that they should not talk any more
about Mary Hart. Then she changed the
subject to the more congenial one of clothes,
and became eloquent over some of the triumphs
of her dressmaker. Finally, in a fit of
generosity, she offered to let Sue try on the
other muslin dress. Sue was enchanted.
"And then we can play something!" she
cried. "Oh, there are all kinds of things we
can play in these, Clarice."</p>

<p>"I guess not!" said Clarice. "Play in my
new dresses, and get them all tumbled? Sue
Penrose, you are too childish. I never saw
anything like the way you keep wanting to
play all the time. I should think you were
ten, instead of thirteen."</p>

<p>Much abashed, Sue begged again for forgiveness.
She did not see so very much fun
in just putting on somebody else's dress and
then taking it off again, but she submitted
meekly when Clarice slipped it over her head.
But the same difficulty arose again: the dress
would not come anywhere near meeting round
Sue's free, natural figure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"Here," said Clarice; "wait a minute, Sue.
I've got another pair of stays. We'll fix it
in a moment."</p>

<p>Sue protested, but was overruled. Clarice
was determined, she said, to see how her little
friend would look if she were properly dressed
for once. In a few moments she was fastened
into the blue muslin, and Clarice was telling
her that she looked too perfectly sweet for
anything.</p>

<p>"Now <i>that</i> is the way for you to dress, Sue
Penrose. If I were you I should insist upon
my mother's getting me a pair of stays to-morrow.
Why, you look like a different girl.
Why, you have an alegant figure&mdash;perfectly
alegant!"</p>

<p>But poor Sue was in sore discomfort, and
no amount of "alegance" could make her at
ease. She could hardly breathe; she felt
girded by a ring of iron. Oh, it was impossible;
it was unbearable!</p>

<p>"I never, never could, Clarice!" she protested.
"Unhook it for me; please do! Yes,
it is very pretty, but I cannot wear it another
moment."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>She persisted, in spite of Clarice's laughing
and calling her a little countrified goose, and
was thankful to find herself free once more,
and back in her own good belted frock.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clarice," she said, "if you only <i>knew</i>
how comfortable this was, you would have
your dresses made so; I know you would."</p>

<p>"The idea!" said Clarice. "I guess not,
Sue. Have some more candy? My, how my
head aches!"</p>

<p>"It is this close room," said Sue, eagerly.
"Clarice, dear, you are looking dreadfully
pale. See, it has stopped raining now. Do
let us come out; I know the fresh air will do
you good."</p>

<p>But Clarice shook her head, and said that
walking always made her head worse, and
she should get her death of cold, besides.</p>

<p>"Then lie down, and let me read to you.
Why, I forgot; I have 'Rob Roy' in my
pocket; I wondered what made it so heavy.
I remember, now, I did think it might possibly
rain, so I brought 'Rob' in case. There,
dear, lie down and let me tuck you up. Oh,
Clarice, you do look so lovely lying down! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
always think of you when I want to think of
the Sleeping Beauty. There, now; shut your
eyes and rest, while I read."</p>

<p>Clarice detested "Rob Roy," but her head
really did ache,&mdash;she had been eating candy
all the afternoon and most of the morning,&mdash;and
there was nothing else to do. She lay
back and closed her eyes. They were dreadfully
stupid people in this book, and she could
hardly understand a word of the "Scotch
stuff" they talked. She wished she had
brought "Wilful Pansy, the Bride of an
Hour," or some other "alegant" paper novel.
And thinking these thoughts, Clarice presently
fell asleep, which was perhaps the best thing
she could do.</p>

<p>Sue read on and on, full of glory and rejoicing.
Di Vernon was one of her favorite
heroines, and she fairly lived in the story
while she was reading it. She was in the
middle of one of Di's impassioned speeches
when a sound fell on her ear, slight but unmistakable.
She looked up, her eyes like
stars, the proud, ringing words still on her
lips. Clarice was asleep, her head thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
back, her mouth open, peacefully snoring.
Another snore, and another! Sue closed the
book softly. It was a pity that Clarice had
lost that particular chapter, it was so splendid;
but she was tired, poor darling, and her
head ached. It was the best thing, of course,
that she should have fallen asleep. Sue
would watch her sleep, and keep all evil
things away. It was not clear what evil
things could come into the quiet room of the
respectable family hotel, but whatever they
might be, Sue was ready for them.</p>

<p>Sue's ideas of hotel life had become considerably
modified since she had had some actual
experience of it. Instead of being one round of
excitement, as she had fancied, she was obliged
to confess that it was often very dull. The
Binns House was a quiet house, frequented
mostly by "runners," who came and went,
and with a small number of permanent boarders&mdash;old
couples who were tired of housekeeping,
or ancient single gentlemen. The
frescoes and mirrors were there, but the latter
reflected only staid middle-aged faces, or else
those of bearded men who carried large handbags,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
and wore heavy gold watch-chains, and
smelt of strong tobacco and cheap perfumery.
Even the table, with its array of little covered
dishes that had once promised all the delights
of fairy banquets, proved disappointing.
To lift a shining cover which ought to conceal
something wonderful with a French name, and
to find squash&mdash;this was trying; and it had
happened several times. Also, there was a
great deal of mincemeat, and it did not compare
with Katy's. And the bearded men gobbled,
and pulled things about, and talked
noisily. Altogether, it was as different as
could well be imagined from Sue's golden
dream. And it was simply impossible to use
the soap they had, it smelt so horribly.</p>

<p>Hark! was that a foot on the stairs? Suppose
something were really going to happen
now, while Clarice was asleep! Suppose she
should hear voices, and the door should open
softly, softly, and a villainous face look in&mdash;a
bearded face, not fat and good-natured looking
like those people's at dinner, but a haggard
face with hollow, burning eyes and a
savage scowl. Some robber had heard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Clarice's jewelry and her father's wealth, and
had come all the way from New York (there
were no robbers in Hilton) to rob, perhaps
to murder her. Ah! but Sue would fling
herself before the unconscious sleeper, and
cry: "Back, villain, or I slay thee with my
hands!" He might go then; but if he didn't,
she would throw the lamp at him. She and
Mary had decided long ago that that was the
best thing to do to a robber when you had no
weapons, because the oil and glass together
would be sure to frighten him. And&mdash;and&mdash;oh!
what was that?</p>

<p>This time it was no fancy. A man's voice
was heard in the hall below; a man's foot
came heavily up the stairs, and passed into
the next room. A hand was laid on the
latch.</p>

<p>"Clarissy, are you here?" asked the voice.</p>

<p>Sue sprang to her feet. It was Mr. Packard.
What should she do? Mr. Packard
was no robber, but Sue did not like him, and
it seemed quite out of the question that he
should find her here, with Clarice asleep.
Seizing her tam and her jacket, and slipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
"Rob Roy" into her pocket, she opened the
window softly, and stepped out on the balcony
which formed the roof of the hotel porch.
She might have gone out of the other door,
but the window was nearer; besides, it was
much more exciting, and he might have seen
her in the passage. Sue closed the window
behind her, with a last loving glance at Clarice,
who snored quietly on; and just as Mr.
Packard entered the room she climbed over
the balustrade and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>"What upon earth is that?" asked Mrs.
Binns, looking out of the window of the office,
which was on the ground floor. "Somebody
shinnin' down the door-post!&mdash;a boy, is it?
Do look, Mr. Binns. I ain't got my glasses."</p>

<p>Mr. Binns looked.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say!" he remarked, with
a slow chuckle. "It's Mis' Penrose's little
gal. Well, she is a young 'un, to be sure!
Be'n up to see the Packard gal, I s'pose.
Now, you'd think she'd find the door easier;
most folks would. But it wouldn't be Sue
Penrose to come out the door while the' was
a window handy by, <i>and</i> a post."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"Sue Penrose is gettin' too big to go
shinnin' round the street that way," said Mrs.
Binns. "I don't care for that Packard gal
myself; she's terrible forthputtin', and
triflin' and greedy, besides; but you wouldn't
see her shinnin' down door-posts, anyway."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mr. Binns. "She don't
know enough!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="s08">THE MYSTERY, AND WHAT CAME OF IT</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Mary! Mary Hart! I want to speak
to you. Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary, looking up
from her mending. "I am just finishing
Teddy's stockings; he does tear them so.
Come in, Sue."</p>

<p>"Hush! No; I want you to come out,
Mary. It's something very important.
Don't say a word to any one, but come down
to the arbor this minute. I must see you
alone. Oh, I am so excited!"</p>

<p>The arbor was at the farther end of the
Harts' garden&mdash;a pleasant, mossy place with
seats, and a great vine climbing over it.
Mary put away her basket methodically, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
joined Sue, whom she found twittering with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, what do you think? But first
you must promise not to tell a living soul.
Honest and true, black and blue! Promise,
Mary, or my lips are sealed forever!"</p>

<p>"I promise," said Mary, without thinking.</p>

<p>Sue's tremendous secrets were not generally
very alarming.</p>

<p>Sue drew a long breath, looked around her,
said "Hush!" two or three times, and began:</p>

<p>"Isn't it perfectly splendid, Mary? The
circus is coming to Chester on the 24th,
and Clarice and I are going. It is going
to be the greatest show in the world; the
paper says so; and I've seen the pictures,
and they are simply glorious. Isn't it fine?
Clarice has asked me to spend the day with
her at the hotel, and Mother says I may; and
Clarice is going to treat me. Mary, she is
the most generous girl that ever lived in this
world. You don't half appreciate her, but
she is."</p>

<p>"Who is going to take you to the circus?"
asked practical Mary. "Mr. Packard?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush! No. That is the exciting part of
it. We are going alone, just by ourselves."</p>

<p>"Sue! You cannot! Go up to Chester
alone&mdash;just you two girls?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Clarice is much older than I,
you know, Mary. Clarice is fifteen, and she
says it is perfectly absurd for us to be such
babies as we are. She says that in New
York girls of our age wear dresses almost
full length, and put up their hair, and&mdash;and
all kinds of things. She says it's just because
we live down East here that we are so
countrified. And she knows all about going
to places, and she has lots of money, and&mdash;and
so&mdash;oh, Mary, isn't it exciting?"</p>

<p>"What does your mother say?" asked
Mary, slowly. "Is she willing, Sue?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell her!" said Sue.</p>

<p>Her tone was defiant, but she colored high,
and did not look at Mary as she spoke.</p>

<p>"You are not&mdash;going&mdash;to tell your
mother?" repeated Mary, in dismay. "Oh,
Sue!"</p>

<p>"Now, hush, hush, Mary Hart, and listen
to me! Clarice says what's the use? She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
says it would only worry Mother, and I
ought not to worry her when she is so delicate.
She says she thinks it is a great
mistake for girls to keep running to their
mothers about everything when they are as
big as we are. She <i>never</i> does, she says&mdash;well,
it's her aunt, but that makes no difference,
she says; and she is fifteen, you know.
Besides, my mother is very different from
yours; you know she is, Mary. I suppose I
<i>should</i> want to tell things to your mother if
she was mine. But you know perfectly well
how Mamma is; she never seems to care,
and it only bothers her and makes her head
ache."</p>

<p>"Sue, how can you talk so? Your mother
is ill so much of the time, of course she can't&mdash;can't
be like my Mammy, I suppose."</p>

<p>Mary faltered a little as she said this. She
had often wished that Mrs. Penrose would
take more interest in Sue's daily life, but she
felt that this was very improper talk.</p>

<p>"I don't think you ought to talk so, Sue!"
she said stoutly. "I am sure you ought
not. I think Clarice Packard has a very bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
influence over you, and I wish she had never
come here."</p>

<p>"Clarice says you are jealous, Mary, and
that you try to make trouble between her and
me. I don't believe that; but you have <i>no</i>
imagination, and you cannot appreciate Clarice.
If you knew what she has done for me&mdash;how
she has opened my eyes."</p>

<p>Sue's vivid face deepened into tragedy.
"Mary, I believe I will tell you, after all. I
didn't mean to,&mdash;Clarice warned me not to,&mdash;but
I will. Mary, there is a mystery in
my life. Hush! don't speak&mdash;don't say a
word! I am a foundling!"</p>

<p>If Mary had been less amazed and distressed,
she must have laughed aloud. Sue,
in her brown holland frock, her pretty hair
curling round her face, her eyes shining with
excitement, was the very image of her mother.
As it was, Mary could only gasp, and gaze
round-eyed.</p>

<p>"I am! I am sure of it!" Sue hurried on.
"It explains everything, Mary: Mamma's
not caring more, and my feeling the way I
do, and everything. Clarice says she is sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
it must be so. She knows a girl, the most
beautiful girl she ever saw, and she never
knew it till she grew up, because they were
so fond of her; but she was left on their door-step
in a wicker basket lined with pink satin,
and a note pinned to her clothes saying that
her parents were English noblemen, but they
never would acknowledge her because she
wasn't a boy. And so! And you know I
have always felt that there was <i>something
wrong</i>, Mary Hart, and that I was not like
other children; you know I have!"</p>

<p>"I know you have often talked very foolishly,"
said Mary, "but I never heard you
say anything wicked before. Sue, this is
downright wicked, and ridiculous and absurd
besides. I never heard such nonsense in my
life, and I don't want to hear any more of it."</p>

<p>Both girls had risen to their feet, and stood
facing each other. Mary was flushed with
distress and vexation; but Sue had turned
very pale.</p>

<p>"Very well!" she said, after a pause. "I
see Clarice is right. You have a mean, jealous
spirit, Mary. I thought I could tell the&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
great thing of my life, to my most
intimate friend,&mdash;for you <i>have</i> been my most
intimate friend,&mdash;and you would understand;
but you don't. You never have understood
me; Clarice has said so from the beginning,
and now I know she is right. At least, I have
<i>one</i> friend who can feel for me. Good-by, Mary&mdash;forever!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sue!" cried Mary, wanting to laugh
and cry together. But Sue was gone, dashing
through the garden at tempest speed,
and flinging the gate to behind her with a
crash.</p>

<p>Mary went into the house, and cried till
she could not see. But there were no tears
for Sue. She ran up to her room, and locked
the door. Then, after looking carefully
around, she drew out from under the bed an
old brown leather writing-desk, produced a
key that hung by a ribbon round her neck,
unlocked the desk, and took out a faded red
morocco blank-book. It had once been
an account-book, and had belonged to her
grandfather; the great thing about it was
that it had a lock and key! Opening it, Sue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
found a blank page, and flinging herself over
the table, began to write furiously:</p>

<p>"Mary and I have parted&mdash;parted forever.
She was my dearest upon earth, but I know
her no more. Her name is Hart, but she has
none, or at least it is of marble. I am very
unhappy, a poor foundling, with but one
friend in the world. I sit alone in my gloomy
garet." (The sun was pouring in at the window,
but Sue did not see it.) "My tears blot
the page as I write." (She tried to squeeze out
a tear, failed, and hurried on.) "My affecktions
are blited, but I am proud, and they shall see
that I don't care one bit how mean they are.
I am of noble blood, I feel it corsing in my
viens, and I shouldn't wonder a bit if I were
a princess. And if I die young, Mary Hart
can come and shed tears on my moniment
and be sorry she acted so."</p>

<p>Meantime, in the room below, little Lily
was saying: "Mamma, I wish I had some one
to play with. Couldn't you get me another
sister, about my age? Sue says she is too
old to play with me!" And Mrs. Penrose
was sighing, and wondering again why her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
elder child was not the comfort to her that
Mary Hart was to her mother.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illus05" id="illus05"></a>
<img src="images/illus05.jpg" width="389" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"'MARY AND I HAVE PARTED&mdash;PARTED FOREVER.'"</p>
</div>

<p>The days that followed were sad ones for
Mary. The intimacy between her and Sue
had been so close that they had never felt
the need of other friends; and, indeed, in
their small neighborhood it happened that
there were no pleasant girls of their own age.
It had not seemed possible that anything
could ever come between her and Sue. They
loved to say that they were two halves, and
only together made a whole. Now it was
bitter to see Sue pass by on the other side of
the home street with averted eyes and head
held high. Mary tried to greet her as usual;
for had they not said a hundred times how
silly it was for girls to quarrel, and what spectacles
they made of themselves behaving like
babies?</p>

<p>But it was of no use. The breach was
complete; and Sue refused to speak to Mary,
or even to recognize her, and had only the
most frigid little nod for her brothers. Many
a time did Mary curl up for comfort in her
mother's lap, and rest her head on her shoulder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and tell her how it hurt, and ask what she
should do, and how she should live without
her friend. She never failed to find comfort;
and always, after a good little talk, there was
something that Mrs. Hart particularly wanted
done, and that Mary could help her so much
with; and Mary found that there is no balm
like work for a sore heart.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Hart said: "Mary, how would
you like to ask little Lily to come and spend
the afternoon with you? Mrs. Penrose is
really very far from well, and Sue seems to be
entirely absorbed. It would be a kind thing
to do, daughter."</p>

<p>So Lily came; and in making her happy
Mary forgot the sore spot in her own heart.
From that day the two were a good deal together.
Beside Sue's glancing brightness
Lily had seemed rather a dull child; or perhaps
it was merely that Mary had no thought
to give her, and felt with Sue that children
were in the way when one wanted to talk
seriously. But in Mary's companionship the
child expanded like a flower. She was so
happy, so easily pleased. It was delightful to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
see her face light up at sight of Mary. And
Mary determined that, come what might, she
and Lily would always be friends. "And,
Lily," she would whisper, "if&mdash;no! <i>when</i> we
get our Sue back again, won't she be surprised
to see how much you have learned,
and how many of our plays you know? And
there will be three of us then, Lily."</p>

<p>And Lily would smile and dimple, and look
almost a little like Sue&mdash;almost!</p>

<p>The boys, too, were a great comfort in
those days. Never had Tom been so considerate,
so thoughtful. Hardly a day passed
but he would want Mary to play or walk or
fish with him. She had never, it seemed,
seen so much of Tom before, though he had
always been the dearest boy in the world&mdash;except
Teddy.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried one day, when Tom, after
an hour's patient search, found the silver
thimble that she had carelessly dropped in
the orchard&mdash;"oh, it <i>is</i> good to have a brother
Tom. I don't see what girls do who
have none."</p>

<p>"It's pretty nice to have a sister Mary,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
said Tom, shyly; he was always shy when
there was any question of feeling. "Do you
know, Ballast&mdash;do you know, I've never had
so much sister Mary as I've been having lately.
Of course it's a great shame about Sue, and
I miss her no end, and all that&mdash;but it's
nice to have such a lot of you, dear."</p>

<p>Sister and brother exchanged a silent hug
that meant a good deal, and Mary inwardly
resolved that, come what might, Tom should
always hereafter have all the sister Mary he
wanted.</p>

<p>"And it's simply no end for Lily," Tom
added. "Lily has never had a fair chance,
you know, Mary."</p>

<p>"Lily is a very nice little girl," said Teddy,
with kind condescension. "There's a great
deal more in Lily than people think. Mary,
if you are going over there, you might take
her these horse-chestnuts. She likes the
milky ones, before they turn brown."</p>

<p>"Take them yourself, Master Teddy!" said
Mary, laughing. "You know it's what you
want to do. Bring her over, and we'll go
and play in the orchard, all four of us. We'll
play 'Wolf,' if you like."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Teddy. "Let's play
'Indian'; let's play 'The Last of the Mo's.'
We haven't played that for ever and ever
so long."</p>

<p>"Lily doesn't know 'The Last of the Mohicans,'"
said Mary. "She has never read it.
I'll read it to her, I think. We might begin
the next rainy day, boys, and all read
together."</p>

<p>"Hooray!" said both boys.</p>

<p>"I can be making my new net," said Tom.</p>

<p>"And I can work on my boat," said Teddy.</p>

<p>"And I have about six dozen things to
make for Christmas!" said Mary, laughing.
"Who is to do the reading, I should like to
know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mammy will read it to us."</p>

<p>"All right! Hurrah for Mammy! Of course
she will."</p>

<p>"But that is no reason why we should not
play 'The Last of the Mo's' now," resumed
Tom. "We can tell Lily enough, as we go
along, to show her what it's like, and of
course she wouldn't take an important part,
anyway&mdash;just a squaw or an odd brave. Cut
along, Teddy, and bring the kid over."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>Lily came hurrying back with Teddy; and
the four stood for a moment together by the
front door, laughing and chatting, and giving
out the parts for the game. They had never
played it before without Sue. Mary would
rather not have played it now, but that seemed
no reason why the boys should not have their
favorite game, and no doubt Tom could play
Uncas very well&mdash;though, of course, not <i>as</i>
well, even if he was a boy.</p>

<p>Tom was just striking an attitude and brandishing
an imaginary tomahawk, when, on the
opposite side of the street, Sue came along,
arm in arm, as usual, with Clarice Packard.
The Hart children looked in dismay. Was
this their Sue? Something was wrong with
her hair. It was rolled up high over her
forehead, and bobbed up into a short cue
behind. Something was wrong with her feet;
at least, so it seemed from the way she
walked, mincing on her toes. And she had
a spotted veil on, and she carried a parasol.
Was this their Quicksilver Sue? Could it
be?</p>

<p>As they passed, Clarice looked across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
way and bowed a triumphant little bow; then
tittered rudely, and whispered something in
her companion's ear. Sue held her head
high, and was walking past looking straight
before her, as she always did now, when suddenly
it seemed as if some feeling took hold
upon her, stronger than her own will. She
turned her head involuntarily, and looked at
the group standing on the familiar door-step.
A wave of color swept over her face; the
tears rushed into her eyes. For a moment
she seemed to waver, almost to sway toward
them; then resolutely she turned her head
away again, and walked on.</p>

<p>"Mary," said Tom, "do you know what?"</p>

<p>"No, Tom. I don't know this particular
'what.' I know&mdash;what you saw just now."
And poor Mary looked as if the heart for play
was clean gone out of her.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you. Our Sue has had just
about enough of her new treasure. I'll bet
my new fishing-line that she would give all
her best boots to come and play 'Last of the
Mo's' with us in the orchard."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="s08">THE CIRCUS</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Tom was right. That moment was
the turning-point for Sue Penrose.
When she saw that group on the
familiar door-step across the way, something
seemed to clutch at her heart, something
seemed to fall from her eyes. What did this
all mean? There were her friends, her dear
old friends, with their honest faces and their
clear, kind, true eyes. She had seen the
longing look in Mary's eyes, and Tom's grave
glance which seemed to say that he was sorry
for her. It was the afternoon playtime, and
they were all going to play together some of
the happy boy-and-girl plays in which she,
Sue, had always been the leader; and she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
not with them. She had lost them all, and
for what? All at once, Clarice's giggle, her
whispered talk of dresses and parties and
"gentlemen friends" sounded flat and silly
and meaningless. What did Sue care for
such stuff? How could she ever have thought
she cared? What would she not give for a
good romp in the orchard, and a talk with
Mary afterward! A small voice said in her
heart: "Go back! A kiss to Mary, a word
to the boys, and all will be forgotten. Go
back now, before it is too late!"</p>

<p>But two other voices spoke louder in Sue's
ear, drowning the voice of her heart. One
was pride. "Go back?" it said. "Confess
that you have been wicked and silly? Let
the boys and Lily see you humbling yourself&mdash;you,
who have always been the proud one?
Never!" The other was loyalty, or rather a kind
of chivalry that was a part of Sue. "You cannot
desert Clarice," said this voice. "She is
a stranger here, and she depends upon you.
She is delicate and sensitive, and you are the
only person who understands her; she says so.
She isn't exactly nice in some ways, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
others are hard on her, and you must stand
by her. You cannot go back!"</p>

<p>So when Clarice tittered, and whispered
something about Mary's dress, Sue pressed
her arm, and straightened herself and walked
on, looking steadfastly before her.</p>

<p>"My! Sue, what is the matter?" her companion
asked. "You look as cross as a
meat-ax. No wonder! I call the way that
boy stared at you downright impudent. They
seem to have taken up with Lily, now that
they can't get you. He, he!"</p>

<p>And a new sting was planted in Sue's
heart, already sore enough. Yes; they had
taken up with Lily; Lily was filling her place.</p>

<p>Sue took the pain home with her, and carried
it about all day, and many a day. The
little sister had never been much to her, as
we have seen. Her own life had been so
overflowing with matters that seemed to her
of vital importance that she had never had
much time to bestow on the child who was too
old to be set down with blocks and doll and
told to amuse herself, and yet was too young&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
so Sue thought&mdash;to share the plays
of the older children. She had "wished to
goodness" that Lily had some friend of her
own age; and "Don't bother!" was the answer
that rose most frequently to her lips
when Lily begged to be allowed to play with
her and Mary.</p>

<p>"Don't bother, Lily. Run along and amuse
yourself; that's a good girl! We are busy
just now." She had never meant to be unkind;
she just hadn't thought, that was all.</p>

<p>Well, Lily did not have to be told now not
to bother. There was no danger of her asking
to join Sue and Clarice, for the latter had
from the first shown a dislike to the child
which was heartily returned. People who
"think children are a nuisance" are not apt
to be troubled by their company.</p>

<p>After the morning hour during which she
sat with their mother, reading to her and
helping her in various ways (how was it, by
the way, that Lily had got into the way of
doing this? she, Sue, had never had time, or
had never thought of it!), Lily was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
over at the Harts' in these days. Often when
Sue and Clarice were sitting upstairs, talking,&mdash;oh,
such weary, empty, stupid talk, it
seemed now!&mdash;the sound of Lily's happy
laughter would come from over the way and
ring in her sister's ears.</p>

<p>They were playing Indians again, were
they? "The Last of the Mohicans"! Tom
was Hawkeye, of course; but who was
Uncas in her stead? She had always been
Uncas. She knew a good many of his
speeches by heart. Ah! she thrilled, recalling
the tremendous moment when the Delawares
discover the tortoise tattooed on the
breast of the young hero. She recalled how
"for a single instant Uncas enjoyed his triumph,
smiling calmly on the scene. Then
motioning the crowd away with a high and
haughty sweep of the arm, he advanced in
front of the nation with the air of a king, and
spoke in a voice louder than the murmur of
admiration that ran through the multitude.</p>

<p>"'Men of the Lenni-Lenape,' he said, 'my
race upholds the earth. Your feeble tribe
stands on my shell. What fire that a Delaware
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
can light would burn the child of my
fathers?' he added, pointing proudly to the
simple blazonry on his skin. 'The blood
that came from such a stock would smother
your flames!'"</p>

<p>Ah! and then the last speech, that she
always spoke leaning against a tree, with her
arms folded on her breast, and her gaze fixed
haughtily on the awe-struck spectators: "Pale-face!
I die before my heart is soft!" and so
on. They all said she did that splendidly&mdash;better
than any one else.</p>

<p>What was Clarice saying?</p>

<p>"And I said to him, I said: 'I don't know
what you mean,' I said. 'Oh, yes, you do,'
he said. 'No, I don't,' I said. 'I think
you're real silly,' I said. And he said: 'Oh,
don't say that,' he said. 'Well, I shall,' I
said. 'You're just as silly as you can be!'"
And so on and so on, till Sue could have fallen
asleep for sheer weariness, save for those
merry voices in her ear and the pain at her
heart.</p>

<p>But when Clarice was gone, Sue unlocked
her journal and wrote:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very unhappy, and no one cares. I
am alone in the world, and I feel that I have
not long to live. My cheek is hollow, and
my eyes gleam with an unnatural light; but I
shall rest in the grave and no one will morn
for me. I hear the voices of my former
friends, but they think no more of the lonely
outcast. I do hope that if I should live to be
fifteen I shall have more sense than some
people have; but she is all I have left in the
world, and I will be faithful to death. They
have taken my sister from me&mdash;" But when
she had written these last words Sue blushed
hotly, and drew her pen through them; for
she was an honest child, and she knew they
were not true.</p>

<p>Then she went downstairs. Her room was
too lonely, and everything in it spoke too
plainly of Mary. She could not stay there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penrose looked up as she entered the
sitting-room. "Oh! it is you, Sue," she said,
with her little weary air; "I thought it was
Lily."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to read to you,
Mamma?" asked Sue, with a sudden impulse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," said Mrs. Penrose,
doubtfully; "isn't Clarice here? Yes, I
should like it very much, Sue. My eyes are
rather bad to-day."</p>

<p>Sue read for an hour, and forgot the pain
at her heart. When the reading was over,
her mother said: "Thank you, my dear; that
was a real treat. How well you read, Sue!"</p>

<p>"Let me read to you every day, Mother,"
said Sue. She kissed her mother warmly;
and, standing near her, noticed for the first
time how very pale and thin she was, how
transparent her cheek and hands. Her heart
smote her with a new pain. How much more
she saw, now that she was unhappy herself!
She had never thought much about her
mother's ill health. She was an "invalid,"
and that seemed to account for everything.
At least, she could be a better daughter while
she lived, and could help her mother in the
afternoon, as Lily did in the morning.</p>

<p class="p2">The day of the circus came. A week ago,
how Sue had looked forward to it! It was to
be the crowning joy of the season, the great,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the triumphal day. But now all was changed.
She had no thought of "backing out"; an
engagement once made was a sacred thing
with Sue; but she no longer saw it wreathed
in imaginary glories. The circus was fun, of
course; but she was not going in the right
way, she knew&mdash;in fact, she was going in a
very naughty way; and Clarice was no longer
the enchanting companion she had once
seemed, who could cast a glamour over everything
she spoke of. Sue even suggested
their consulting Mr. Packard; but Clarice
raised a shrill clamor.</p>

<p>"Sue, don't speak of such a thing! Puppa
would lock me up if he had any idea; he's
awfully strict, you know. And we have both
vowed never to tell; you know we have, Sue.
You vowed on this sacred relic; you know
you did!"</p>

<p>The sacred relic was a battered little medal
that Clarice said had come from Jerusalem
and been blessed by the Pope. As this was
almost the only flight of fancy she had ever
shown, Sue clung to the idea, and had made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
the vow with all possible solemnity, feeling
like Hannibal and Robert of Normandy in
one. This was not, however, until after she
had told Mary of the plan; but, somehow, she
had not mentioned that to Clarice. Mary
would not tell, of course; perhaps, at the
bottom of her heart, Sue almost wished she
would.</p>

<p>The day was bright and sunny, and Sue
tried hard to feel as if she were going to have
a great and glorious time; yet when the hour
came at which she had promised to go to the
hotel, she felt rather as if she were going to
execution. She hung round the door of her
mother's room. Could this be Sue, the foundling,
the deserted child of cloudy British
princes?</p>

<p>"If you need me, Mamma, I won't go!"
she said several times; but Mrs. Penrose did
not notice the wistful intonation in her voice,
and she had not yet become accustomed to
needing Sue.</p>

<p>"No, dear!" she said. "Run along, and
have a happy day. Lily and Katy will do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
all I need." Then, with an impulse she
hardly understood herself, for she was an
undemonstrative woman, she added: "Give
me a kiss before you go, Susie!"</p>

<p>Sue hung round her neck in a passionate
embrace. "Mamma!" she exclaimed,
"Mamma! if I were very, very wicked, could
you forgive me?&mdash;if I were very dreadfully
wicked?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, dear!" said Mrs. Penrose,
settling her hair. She had pretty hair, and
did not like to have it disarranged. "But
you are not wicked, Sue. What is the matter,
my dear?"</p>

<p>But Sue, after one more almost strangling
embrace, ran out of the room. She felt suffocated.
She must have one moment of relief
before she went. Dashing back to her room,
she flung herself upon her journal.</p>

<p class="p2">"I go!" she wrote. "I go because I have
sworn it, and I may not break my word. It
is a dreadful thing that I do, but it is my fate
that bekons. I don't believe I am a foundling,
after all, and I don't care if I am. Mamma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
is just perfectly sweet; and if I <i>should</i> live, I
should never, never, <i>never</i> let her know that
I had found it out. Adieu!</p>

<p class="left45">"The unfortunate<br />
<span class="smcap i4">"Susan Penrose"</span>.</p>

<p>After making a good flourish under her
name, Sue felt a little better; still, her heart
was heavy enough as she put on her pretty
hat with the brown ostrich-feathers, which
went so well with her pongee dress. At least,
she looked nice, she thought; that was some
comfort.</p>

<p class="p2">The circus was a good one, and for a time
Sue forgot everything else in the joy of looking
on. The tumbling! She had never
dreamed of such tumbling. And the jumping
over three, four, six elephants standing
together! Each time it seemed impossible,
out of the question, that the thing could be
done. Each time her heart stood still for an
instant, and then bounded furiously as the
lithe, elastic form passed like an arrow over
the broad brown backs, and lighted on its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
feet surely, gracefully, with a smile and a
courtly gesture of triumph. That one in the
pale blue silk tights&mdash;could he really be human,
and go about on other days clad like
other men?</p>

<p>Then, the wonderful jokes of the clown!
Never was anything so funny, Sue thought.
But the great, the unspeakable part, was
when the Signora Fiorenza, the Queen of
Flame, rode lightly into the arena on her
milk-white Arabian charger. Such beauty
Sue had never dreamed of; and, indeed, the
Signora (whose name was Betsy Hankerson)
was a handsome young woman enough, and
her riding-habit of crimson velvet, if a little
worn and rubbed, was still effective and
becoming. To Sue's eyes it seemed an imperial
robe, fit for coronations and great state
banquets, or for scenes of glory like this.</p>

<p>Round and round the Signora rode, bending
graciously from the saddle, receiving with
smiling composure the compliments of the
clown.</p>

<p>"Well, madam! how did you manage to
escape the police?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>"The police, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam! All the police in Chester&mdash;and
a fine-looking set of men they are&mdash;are
on your track."</p>

<p>"Why, what have I done, sir, that the
police should be after me?"</p>

<p>"What have you done, madam? Why, you
have stolen all the roses in town and put them
in your cheeks, and you've stolen all the diamonds
and put them in your eyes; and worse
than that!"</p>

<p>"Worse than that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam. You've stolen all the
young fellows' hearts and put them in your
pocket." Whack! "Get up there, Sultan!"</p>

<p>And he smacked the white horse with his
hand, and the Signora cantered gaily on.
This was delightful; and it was all true, Sue
thought, every word of it. Oh, if she could
only look like that, what would she not give?</p>

<p>But now, a new wonder! The Signora had
leaped lightly to her feet, and was standing
on the back of the fiery steed, always galloping,
galloping. She was unfastening the gold
buttons of her riding-habit; it fell off, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
stood transformed, a wonderful fairy in gold-spangled
gauze, with gold slippers, and a
sparkling crown&mdash;had she had it on all the
time under her tall hat?&mdash;set in her beautiful
black hair. The clown shouted with glee,
and Sue could have shouted with him:</p>

<p>"Glory hallelujah! See the fireworks!
Oh, my! somebody get my smoked glasses;
she puts my eyes clean out. Smoked glass,
ladies and gentlemen, five cents a piece!
You'll all go stone-blind if you try to look
at her without it."</p>

<p>The music quickened its time, the snow-white
steed quickened his pace. The Signora
called to him and shook the reins, and the
good beast sprang forward in response. Faster
and faster, louder and louder, till the air was
palpitating with sound, and that glittering
figure flashed by like a fiery star. And now
two men in livery came running out, holding
a great ring of living flame. They sprang
up on two stools. They held the ring steady
while the flames leaped and danced, and Sue
fancied she could actually hear them hiss.
The clown shouted and waved his hat; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
ring-master cracked his whip; the music
crashed into a maddening peal; and with a
flash and a cry, horse and girl dashed through
the circle of fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illus06" id="illus06"></a>
<img src="images/illus06.jpg" width="347" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AT THE CIRCUS.</p>
</div>

<p>It was over. The flames were gone. The
Signora was once more seated, cantering easily
round the ring, bending again to the clown's
remarks. But Sue still sat breathless, her
hands clasped together, her eyes shining.
For a time she could not speak. At last she
turned to Clarice with burning cheeks and
fluttering breath.</p>

<p>"Clarice, from this moment that is what I
live for! I can do that, Clarice, I know; I
feel that I can. Do you suppose she would
take me as a pupil? Do you think she
would? If I can do that just once, then I
can die happy!"</p>

<p>"How you talk, Sue Penrose!" said Clarice.
"The idea! Who ever heard of a
young lady going into a circus? Say, don't
look over opposite. Those horrid Hart boys
are over there, and they've been staring at
you as if you belonged to them. Such impudence!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="s08">THE LONELY ROAD</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The day of the circus was not a
happy one for Mary Hart. She
watched Sue go down the street,
and her heart went out toward her friend.
What a darling she was! How pretty she
looked, and how well the plumed hat set off
her delicate, high-bred face, and the little air
she had of owning the world and liking her
possession! Now that there were no mincing
steps beside her, she walked with her own
free, graceful gait, head held high, eyes bent
forward, ready for anything.</p>

<p>"She ought really to be a princess," thought
humble-minded Mary; and in her glow of admiration
she did not see the troubled look in
Sue's bright eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>The day went heavily. The boys, too, went
off to the circus in the afternoon. Mary
might have gone with them, but she had been
given her choice between this treat and the
concert that was coming off a week or two
later, and had chosen the latter. If she and
Sue could have gone together with the boys,
that would have been another matter. She
longed to tell the boys her secret, and beg
them to keep an eye on Sue, in case she
should get into any trouble. Several times
the words were on the tip of her tongue, but
the thought of her promise drove them back.
She had promised in the solemn school-boy
formula, "Honest and true, black and blue";
and that was as sacred as if she had sworn on
any number of relics. There was a dreadful
passage in "Lalla Rookh": "Thine oath!
thine oath!"</p>

<p>She and Sue had decided long ago that
they would not take oaths, but that a promise
should be just as binding. The promise lay
heavy on Mary's heart all day. She found it
hard to settle down to anything. Sue's face
kept coming between her and her work, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
looked at her from the pages of her book.
Her imagination, not very lively as a rule,
was now so excited that it might have been
Sue's own. She saw her friend in every conceivable
and inconceivable danger. Now it
was a railway accident, with fire and every
other accompaniment of terror. She could
hear the crash, the shrieks, and the dreadful
hiss of escaping steam; could see the hideous
wreck in which Sue was pinned down by
burning timbers, unable to escape. Now a
wild beast, a tiger or panther, had escaped
from his cage and sprung in among the terrified
audience of pleasure-seekers. She saw
the glaring yellow eyes, the steel claws. This
time she screamed aloud, and frightened Lily
Penrose, who, luckily, came over at that very
moment to ask advice about the cutting of
her doll's opera-cloak. Mary forced herself
to attend to the cloak, and that did her good;
and there was no reason why Lily should not
be made happy and amused a little. Then
there were some errands to do for her mother,
and then came her music lesson; and so,
somehow or other, the long day wore away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
and the time came for the arrival of the circus
train from Chester. The time came, and the
train with it. Mary heard it go puffing and
shrieking on its way. She stationed herself
at the window to watch for Sue. Soon she
would come by, twinkling all over, quicksilvering
with joy as she did when she had had
a great pleasure&mdash;making the whole street
brighter, Mary always thought. But Sue did
not come. Five o'clock struck; then half-past
five; then six. Still no Sue. In an anguish
of dread and uncertainty, Mary pressed her
face against the pane and gazed up the fast-darkening
street. People came and went,
going home from their work; but no slight,
glancing figure came swinging past. What
had happened? What could have happened?
So great was Mary's distress of mind that she
did not hear her mother come into the room,
and started violently when a hand was laid on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. Hart, "I think the
boys must have missed the train. Why&mdash;why,
Mary, dear child, what is the matter?"
for Mary turned on her a face so white and
wild that her mother was frightened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>"Mary!" she cried. "The boys! Has&mdash;has
anything happened? The train&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Mary, hastily. "It isn't
the boys, mother. The boys will be all right.
It's Sue&mdash;my Sue!"</p>

<p>Then it all came out. Promise or no promise,
Mary must take the consequences. On
her mother's neck she sobbed out the story:
her foolish "solemn promise," the day-long
anxiety, the agony of the last hour.</p>

<p>"Oh, what can have happened to her?"
she cried. "Oh, Mammy, I'm so glad I told
you! I'm so glad&mdash;so glad!"</p>

<p>"Of course you are, my dear little girl,"
said Mrs. Hart. "And now, stop crying,
Mary. Thank goodness, there's your father
driving into the yard this moment. Run and
tell him; he will know just what to do."</p>

<p class="caption">"MARY STATIONED HERSELF AT THE WINDOW."</p>
</div>

<p>The glory was over. The scarlet cloths
and the gold spangles had disappeared behind
the dingy curtains; the music had gone
away in green bags; and the crowd poured
out of the circus, jostling and pushing. Sue
was walking on air. She could hear nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
but that maddening clash of sound, see nothing
but that airy figure dashing through the
ring of flame. To do that, and then to die
suddenly, with the world at her feet&mdash;that
would be the highest bliss, beyond all other
heights; or&mdash;well, perhaps not really quite
to die, but swoon so deep that every one
should think her dead. And then, when they
had wept for hours beside her rose-strewn
bier, the beautiful youth in pale blue silk
tights, he with the spangled velvet trunks,
might bend over her&mdash;having read "Little
Snow-white"&mdash;and take the poisoned comb
out of her hair, or&mdash;or something&mdash;and
say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ow!" cried Clarice, shrilly. "That horrid
man pushed me so, he almost tore my
dress. I think this is perfectly awful! Say,
Sue, let's go and see the Two-headed Girl.
We've lots of time before the train."</p>

<p>Sue for once demurred; she did not feel
like seeing monstrosities; her mind was filled
with visions of beauty and grace. But when
Clarice pressed the point, she yielded cheerfully;
for was it not Clarice's party? But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
already the glow began to fade from her
sky, and the heavy feeling at her heart to
return, as they pushed their way into the
small, dingy tent, where the air hung like a
heavy, poisonous fog.</p>

<p>It happened that they were just behind a
large party of noisy people, men and women
laughing and shouting together, and the
showman did not see them at first. They
had made their way to the front, and were
gazing at the two slim lads who, tightly laced
into one crimson satin bodice, and crowned
with coppery wigs, made the Two-headed
Girl, when the showman&mdash;an ugly fellow
with little eyes set too near together&mdash;tapped
Sue on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Fifty cents, please," he said civilly enough.</p>

<p>Sue looked at him open-eyed.</p>

<p>"Fifty cents," he repeated. "You two
come in without payin'. Quarter apiece,
please."</p>

<p>Sue put her hand to her pocket, which held
both purses (Clarice had no pockets in her
dresses; she said they spoiled the set of the
skirt), but withdrew it in dismay. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
pocket was empty! She turned to Clarice,
who was staring greedily at the monstrosity.
"Clarice!" she gasped. "Clarice! did you&mdash;have
you got the purses?"</p>

<p>"No," said Clarice. "I gave mine to you,
to put in your pocket; don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I do; but&mdash;but it is gone!
They are both gone!"</p>

<p>"Come, none o' that!" said the man.
"You've seen the show, and you've got to
pay for it. That's all right, ain't it? Now
you hand over them fifty cents, little lady;
see? Come! I can't stand foolin' here. I
got my business to attend to."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I haven't it!" said Sue, growing
crimson to the roots of her hair. "Somebody&mdash;my
pocket must have been picked!"
she cried, as the truth flashed upon her. She
recalled the dense crowd, the pushing, the
rough lad who had forced his way between
her and Clarice just at the doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clarice," she said, "my pocket
has certainly been picked! What shall we
do?"</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" echoed Clarice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
"Oh, Sue, how could you? I don't see why
I let you take my purse. There was a ten-dollar
gold piece in it. I might have known
you would lose it!" And she began to whimper
and lament.</p>

<p>This was poor comfort. Sue turned from
her friend, and faced the angry man bravely.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said. "My pocket
has been picked, so I cannot pay you. We
did not know that we had to pay extra for
the side-shows. I hope you will excuse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not much I won't excuse!" said the man,
in a bullying tone, though he did not raise his
voice. "You'll pay me something, young
ladies, before you leave this tent. I ain't
runnin' no free show; this is business, this is,
and I'm a poor man."</p>

<p>Sue looked round her in despair. Only
vacant or boorish faces met her eyes; it was
not a high-class crowd that had come to see
the Two-headed Girl. Suddenly a word of
Mr. Hart's flashed into her mind like a
sunbeam:</p>

<p>"If you are ever in danger away from
home, children, call a&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there a policeman here?" she asked
eagerly. "There must be one outside, I am
sure. Will you call him, please?"</p>

<p>"No; there ain't no policeman!" said the
man, quickly. He glanced warily about
him, and added in a conciliatory tone:
"There ain't no need of any policeman,
young ladies. I guess we can settle this
little matter right now, between ourselves,
friendly and pleasant. You step right in this
way, out of the jam. There's a lady here'll
be real pleased to see you."</p>

<p>He half led, half pushed, the frightened
girls into an inner compartment of the tent,
where a stout, greasy-looking woman was
counting greasy coppers into a bag. The
woman looked up as they entered, still counting:
"Seventy&mdash;seventy-five&mdash;eighty&mdash;and
twenty's a dollar. What's the matter, Ed?"</p>

<p>"These little ladies got their pockets picked,
so they say!" said the man, with a wink.
"They're real ladies; any one can see that
with half an eye. They don't want to rob a
poor man like me. Maybe they've got some
jew'lry or something they'd like to give you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
for the money they owe. You see to 'em,
Min; I got to go back."</p>

<p>With another wink at the woman, and a
leer at the children which was meant to be
attractive, he slipped out, and left them alone
with the stout woman.</p>

<p>"Well!" she began, in a wheedling voice,
"so you had your pockets picked, my dears,
had you? Well, now, that was a shame, I
should say! Let me see!"</p>

<p>She advanced toward Clarice, who retreated
before her, cowering in a corner and
crying: "I haven't got any pocket; it's her!
She took my purse, and now she's lost it.
Oh, dear! I wish we hadn't come!"</p>

<p>"Let me see, dear," said the woman.</p>

<p>She felt Clarice all over with swift, practised
fingers.</p>

<p>"Sure enough, you ain't got no pocket,"
she said. "I thought you might be makin' a
mistake, you see. There! why, what's this?
Stand still, ducky! I wouldn't hurt ye for the
world; no, indeed&mdash;such a sweet, pretty young
lady as you be. Ain't this a pretty chain,
now? and a locket on the eend of it&mdash;well, I
never! It ain't safe for young ladies to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
goin' round alone with such a lot of jew'lry.
Why, you might be murdered for it, and laid
welterin' in your blood. I guess I'll take
this, dear, to pay for the show; it'll be safer
for you goin' home, too. What's this, again?
gold stick-pins? Well, now, I call them dangerous!
I don't see what your ma was
thinkin' of, lettin' you come out rigged up
like this. I'm doin' you a kindness takin'
'em off'n ye; they might cost ye your life,
sure as you stand here. There's a terrible
rough set o' folks round these grounds, specially
come night."</p>

<p>All the while she was talking she was
quietly stripping Clarice of her trinkets.
Clarice was too frightened to speak or move;
she could only moan and whimper. But after
the first moment of stupefaction, Sue came
forward with flashing eyes and crimson
cheeks. "How dare you?" she cried.
"How dare you steal her things? Her father
or Mr. Hart&mdash;Mr. George Hart of
Hilton&mdash;will send you the money to-morrow,
everything we owe. You shall not steal our
things, you wicked woman!"</p>

<p>The woman turned on her with an evil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
look. "Highty-tighty!" she said. "Ain't
we fine, miss? I wouldn't talk so free about
stealin', after you stealin' our show, sneakin'
in and thinkin' you'd get it free. No you
don't!" And she caught Sue as she tried to
slip past her out of the tent. "Let's see
what you've got, next."</p>

<p>"Police!" cried Sue. "Help! police!"</p>

<p>Instantly the woman's hand was over her
mouth, and she was held in a grasp of iron.</p>

<p>"You holler ag'in, and I'll strip the clothes
off yer back!" she hissed. "Hold yer tongue,
or I'll call Ed. He won't stand no foolin'!"</p>

<p>Sue struggled fiercely, but it was of no use.
The woman shifted her easily to one arm,
and with the other hand searched her pocket.</p>

<p>"Not even a handkerchief!" she said.
"No jew'lry, neither. Well, your mother's
got sense, anyway. Hallo! here's a ring,
though. Guess I'll take that. Le' go, sis,
or I'll hurt ye."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's not my ring!" gasped Sue,
shaking her head free. "It's hers&mdash;my
friend's. Don't take it!"</p>

<p>"Guess it's mine, now!" said the woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
with a chuckle. She forced back the girl's
slender fingers, and drew off the gold mouse-ring.</p>

<p>"There! now you can go, dears; and next
time, you take my advice, and get some of
your folks to take you to the circus. Ah! and
be thankful I've left you them pretty hats.
I know a little girl as would be pleased to
death with that hat with the feathers; but
you might take cold if I let ye go bare-headed,
and I'm a mother myself."</p>

<p>Trembling, half fainting, the girls found
themselves outside the tent. The grounds
were well-nigh deserted, all the spectators
being gone. Here and there a group of
stragglers leaned on the railings of the neighboring
fence, smoking and talking. Rough-looking
men were at work about the tents,
and some of them looked curiously at the
girls as they hurried along. Neither spoke.
Clarice was still whimpering and crying under
her breath. Sue's eyes were blazing; her
cheeks felt on fire. She ran hastily across
the grounds, dragging Clarice after her by
the hand. She felt every moment as if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
might be seized and carried back to that horrible
den. Suppose the man should be coming
after them now! He might put them
in prison, and her mother would never know
where she was. She choked back the sob
that rose in her throat. On, on, as fast as
feet could fly! At last the palings were
reached and passed. Now they could stop to
draw breath, for they were on the highroad,
and out of sight of the hated inclosure. Panting,
Sue leaned against the fence, and waited
till she should have breath enough to speak
some word of encouragement to her companion.
No one was in sight; there was no
sound save the crickets keeping time in the
grass. All was as peaceful and serene as if
there were no dreadful things or wicked people
in the world. They were not far from the
station now, and once in the train for home,
with the friendly conductor, who knew her and
would take charge of them both&mdash;</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a new thought flashed into
Sue's mind, and struck ice into the fever of
her blood. How long had they been in that
dreadful place? How was it that no one was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
to be seen going toward the station, of all the
throng that had come up with them in the
train?</p>

<p>"Clarice!" she gasped. "I am&mdash;afraid&mdash;we
may miss the train. We must run. It
isn't far now. Run as fast as you possibly
can!"</p>

<p>Clarice answered with a sob; but she began
to run as well as her foolish dress and shoes
would let her. But another answer came at
that moment: a whistle, long and clear, loud
at first, then growing fainter and fainter till it
died away. In desperation the girls flew on
along the road&mdash;to reach the station and find
it empty! The long curve of the rails stretched
away toward home. The train was gone!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="s08">ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_s.jpg" width="50" height="49" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Six o'clock was supper-time in the
little town of Chester, so the usual
loungers had left the station as soon
as the train departed; and by the time the
girls arrived it was deserted, even by the
ticket-seller. No one was in sight; at least,
they saw no one. They were too much absorbed
in their trouble to notice two faces that
peeped at them for a moment round the corner
of the station, and then vanished. They
were alone, six miles from home, with no
money. What were they to do?</p>

<p>Clarice broke out in tearful reproaches:</p>

<p>"Sue Penrose, you have brought us to this!
It is all your fault! I never should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
thought of coming up here if it hadn't been
for you."</p>

<p>Sue looked at her, but made no reply.
Clarice's eyes dropped under the steady
look; she faltered, but hurried on:</p>

<p>"And losing all my money, too! If you
hadn't lost my money, I should not have
been robbed of my beautiful jewelry&mdash;all I
had in the world! and it was worth lots and
lots."</p>

<p>Sue, in bitterness of spirit, thought,
"How about the diamond chain?" but she
said nothing. She felt, suddenly, many years
older than Clarice. Was this a girl of fifteen,
whimpering like a baby? Was this the friend
for whom she had given up Mary?</p>

<p>"And how are we ever to get home?" asked
Clarice, in conclusion.</p>

<p>"We must walk!" said Sue, briefly.</p>

<p>"Walk!" shrieked Clarice. "Sue Penrose,
are you crazy? It's twenty miles, if it's a
step!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Sue. "It's a short six
miles."</p>

<p>"That's just as bad!" moaned Clarice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
"You know I should die before we had gone
a mile; you <i>know</i> I should, Sue! Isn't there
some one we can borrow money from? Can't
we go to the hotel and telephone to somebody
at home?"</p>

<p>They might indeed have done this, but in
her excited state Sue could not think it possible.
Her high-strung, sensitive nature was
strained beyond the possibility of sober judgment;
she could only act, and the action that
began instantly was the only one that she
could think of. Besides, to see more strangers,
perhaps meet with more insults&mdash;never!
They must walk home; there was no other
way; and they must start this instant.</p>

<p>"I am sure you can do it, Clarice," she said,
speaking as cheerfully as she could. "You
can take my arm, and lean on me when you
are tired; and every little while we can sit
down and rest. Come! we must start at
once; it will be dark before we get home,
as it is."</p>

<p>Clarice still protested, but yielded to the
stronger will, and the two girls started on
their lonely walk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>As they turned their backs on the station,
a head was cautiously advanced from behind
the building; a pair of sharp eyes followed
the retreating figures for a few moments, then
the head was as cautiously withdrawn.</p>

<p>The road from Chester to Hilton was a
pleasant one. On one side was the railway,
with the river beyond; on the other, green
meadows rolling up and away to the distant
hills. There were few houses, and these scattered
at long distances. To Sue the road
was familiar and friendly enough; but to
Clarice it seemed an endless way stretching
through an endless desert. She was thoroughly
frightened, and her blood was of the
kind that turns to water; very different from
the fire that filled Sue's veins and made her
ready to meet an army, or charge a windmill
or a railway-train, or anything else that should
cross her path.</p>

<p>Over and over again Clarice lamented that
she had ever come to Hilton.</p>

<p>"Why did I come to this hateful, poky
place?" she wailed. "Aunt Jane didn't
want me to come. She said there wouldn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
be anybody here fit for me to associate with.
Oh! why did I come?"</p>

<p>"I suppose because you wanted to!" said
Sue; and it might have been Mary that
spoke.</p>

<p>"Come, Clarice," she went on more gently,
"we might as well make the best of it. Let's
tell stories. I'll begin, if you like. Do you
know about the Maid of Saragossa? That
is splendid! Or Cochrane's 'Bonny Grizzy'?
Oh! she had to do much worse things than
this, and she never was afraid a bit&mdash;not a
single bit."</p>

<p>Sue told the brave story, and the thrill
in her voice might have warmed an oyster;
but Clarice was not an oyster, and it left her
cold.</p>

<p>"Grizzy is a horrid, ugly name," she said.
"And I think it was real unladylike, dressing
up that way, so there!"</p>

<p>"Clarice!"&mdash;Sue's voice quivered with indignation,&mdash;"when
it was to save her father's
life! How can you? But perhaps you will
care more about the Maid of Saragossa."</p>

<p>But after a while Clarice declared that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
stories only made her more nervous. She
was unconscious of the fact that they had
carried her over two miles of the dreaded six.</p>

<p>"Besides," she said peevishly, "I can't
hear when you are talking, Sue. Listen!
I thought I heard footsteps behind us. I
do! Sue Penrose, there is some one following
us!"</p>

<p>Sue listened. Yes, there were footsteps,
some way behind. "But, my dear," she said,
"this is the highroad! Why should they be
following us? People have a right to walk
on the road&mdash;as good a right as we have."</p>

<p>They stopped a moment, instinctively, and
listened; and the footsteps behind them
stopped too. They went on, and the steps
were heard again, light yet distinct, keeping
the distance between them, neither more nor
less.</p>

<p>Clarice grasped Sue's arm. "They are
tramps or robbers, Sue! We are going to be
murdered. Oh, I shall scream!"</p>

<p>"You will <i>not</i> scream!" said Sue, grasping
her arm in return, and resisting the impulse
to shake it. "You are talking nonsense,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Clarice! I believe&mdash;I believe it is nothing
in the world but an echo, after all. If it
were not for this fog, we could see whether
there was any one there."</p>

<p>She looked back along the road, but the
river-fog was rising white and dense, and
closed in behind them like a curtain.</p>

<p>"They can't see us, anyhow, whoever they
are!" said Sue. "Why, it's exciting, Clarice!
It's like the people in the forest in
'Midsummer-Night's Dream.' If we were
only sure that these were nice people, we
might call, and they could answer, and hunt
round for us, and it would be fine."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's awful! It's just awful!" moaned
Clarice; and she shook with real terror.
"And the worst of it is, I can't walk any
more. I can't, Sue! It's no use! I am
going to faint&mdash;I know I am."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Sue, stoutly, though her
heart sank. "Keep up a little, Clarice, do!
There is a watering-trough a little farther on,
and we can bathe our feet. That will be a
great help; and we must be nearly half-way
home now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>But tight lacing and tight shoes are not
nonsense. They are very real things, and
poor Clarice was really suffering more than
Sue had any idea of. The stitch in her side
was not imaginary this time. She stopped
involuntarily to draw breath; and the footsteps
behind them stopped too, and went on
when they did. There was no longer any
doubt; the girls were being followed.</p>

<p>Clarice began to cry again; and Sue set
her teeth, and felt that a crisis was coming.</p>

<p>"Clarice," she said, "let me see if I can
carry you! I think I can! I know the
way Sir Bedivere did with King Arthur: he
made broad his shoulders to receive his
weight, you know, and round his neck he
drew the languid hands&mdash;kind of pickaback,
you see. You are not heavy; I think I can
do it!"</p>

<p>And she actually took Clarice on her back,
and staggered on perhaps a hundred yards&mdash;till
they both came to the ground, bruised
and breathless.</p>

<p>"I'm going to die!" said Clarice, doggedly.
"I won't walk another step. I may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
just as well be murdered as plain die. I&mdash;can't
see!" and the poor girl sank down,
really half fainting.</p>

<p>Sue set her teeth hard. She dragged Clarice
back from the road, and propped her
against a tree, then took her stand in front
of her. She felt no fear; the quicksilver ran
riot in her veins. If she only had her dagger,
the good sharp dagger paper-knife that
she had worn in her boot for two whole
months, while she was playing cow-boy! It
hurt a good deal, and made holes in her
stockings, so she had given it up. What
would she not give for it now! Or if she
had something poisoned that she could hand
to the people when they came up,&mdash;like Lucrezia
Borgia,&mdash;and see them drop dead at
her feet! But she had nothing! Stop! yes!
her hat-pin, the hat-pin Uncle James had sent
her from Russia! Carefully, with a steady
hand, she drew out the long, sharp steel pin,
and felt its point; then set her back against
the tree, and waited.</p>

<p>The footsteps behind the fog-curtain hesitated,
stopped altogether. There was a silence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
but Sue's heart beat so loud, the sound
seemed to fill the air. All at once, from the
opposite direction came another sound, the
sound of horses' hoofs, the rattle of wheels; and,
as if at a signal, the footsteps came on again,
quickened their pace, were close at hand.
Two figures loomed through the white fog;
paused, as if reconnoitering in the dim half-light.
Then, at sight of Sue standing alone
before her prostrate companion, they broke
into a run, and came up at racing speed,
panting.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Because we're right here!" said Teddy.</p>

<p>"Right here, Quicksilver!" said Tom.</p>

<p>The hat-pin dropped from Sue's hand. A
great sob rose and broke,&mdash;only one!&mdash;and
then&mdash;oh! it didn't matter now if she was
getting to be a big girl. Her arms were
round Tom's neck, and her head was on
his good broad brotherly shoulder, and she
was crying and laughing and saying, "Oh,
Tom! Oh, Tom!" over and over and over
again, till that young gentleman began to be
seriously alarmed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>"I say!" he said; "I wouldn't, Quicksilver!
Come! I wouldn't if I were you!
Teddy, you've got the handkerchief, haven't
you? I had the peanuts, you know."</p>

<p>But Teddy, who was going to be a surgeon,
was stooping over Clarice with keen
professional interest.</p>

<p>"We might haul her down to the river and
put her head in!" he said. "This hat won't
hold water any more; will yours? I say!
don't they still bleed people sometimes, when
they haven't got salts and things? My knife
is just as sharp!"</p>

<p>Poor Clarice started up with a faint scream.
Altogether, these four were so absorbed that
they never heard the approaching wheels,
and Mr. Hart almost ran over them before he
could pull up his horse.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he said. "What upon earth&mdash;now,
Mary, Mary, do be careful, and wait
till I&mdash;Dear me, sirs! What a set of
children! Stand still, Jupiter!"</p>

<p>For Mary had scrambled down among
wheels and legs, and had thrown herself
upon Sue and Tom; and Teddy, abandoning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Clarice, exhausted himself in a vain endeavor
to get his short arms round the three.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, Mary! is it really you? Can
you ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Sue! Sue, my Sue, don't talk so, dear!
It is all my fault, for not telling Mammy this
morning. Oh, Tom, you blessed boy, I
might have known you would take care of
her!"</p>

<p>"Young people," said Mr. Hart, bending
over from the wagon, "perhaps if you would
kindly get in, it might facilitate matters, and
you can continue this highly interesting conversation
as we go along. Other girl faint?
Hand her here, Tom! Put your arm round
my neck, my child&mdash;so! there we are!"</p>

<p>They jogged along in silence for a few
minutes. Sue and Mary had nothing to say
at first&mdash;in words, at least. They sat with
their arms round each other's neck and their
heads together. Now and then one would
make a little murmur, and the other respond;
but for the most part they were still, too full
of joy to speak.</p>

<p>"What happened, Tom?" asked Mr. Hart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
when he thought time enough had elapsed to
quiet the excitement a little.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said Tom, "we saw the girls,
of course; but then we lost sight of them after
the circus,&mdash;I don't know how" (Sue shuddered
and Clarice moaned),&mdash;"so we went
straight to the station. So when they didn't
get there in time for the train, we thought
we'd better wait and see how things were.
So we followed them along&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, we were so frightened!" cried
Sue. "Of course you didn't know how
frightened we were, Tom&mdash;but I had my
hat-pin all ready to stick into you!"</p>

<p>"No! had you?" said Tom, chuckling.</p>

<p>"You young ninny!" said his father.
"Why didn't you join the girls, instead of
hanging behind and scaring them half to
death?"</p>

<p>Tom hung his head. "I&mdash;it was awfully
stupid!" he said. "Because I was a fool,
sir, I suppose, and thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because <i>I</i> was a fool, Mr. Hart!" said Sue.
"Because I had been wicked and hateful and
ungrateful, and a Perfect Pig, and he knew it!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hart sat at her window, sewing her
seam and listening to the music she loved
best, the music of children's voices. There
were five of them, her own three and the
two Penroses; and they were all sitting on
the broad door-step, husking sweet corn and
talking. Sue had just come over; she had
been helping Katy, who had a lame arm.
She looked pale and grave, for the adventure
of two days before seemed still very near;
yet her eyes were full of light as she looked
from one to the other of the children, gazing
as if she could not get her fill. Now and then
she and Mary held out a hand and exchanged
a silent squeeze that meant rivers of speech;
but somehow Tom seemed to be doing most
of the talking.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" he said, holding up an
ear like glossy ivory, every row perfect as a
baby's teeth. "Isn't that bully? Save the
silk, Sue and Lily! We want to make wigs
for the harvest feast to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me!" cried Sue, her eyes kindling.
"A harvest feast? What fun!"</p>

<p>"Why, hasn't Mary told you? You and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Lily are coming to tea, you know, and we
thought we would make it a harvest tea. So
we are all to wear corn-silk wigs, and we're
going to put the candles in Jack-o'-lanterns&mdash;little
ones, you know; squashes, of course,
or apples."</p>

<p>"Apples will be best!" said Mary. "I
have some pound sweets all picked out.
We meant this for a surprise, you know,
Tom, but never mind! It's really better fun
for us all to know."</p>

<p>"Lots!" said Tom. "I forgot, though,
about the surprise part. And then&mdash;it'll be
full moon&mdash;we'll go out Jack-o'-lanterning,
and that'll be no end; and then Mammy
says we can roast chestnuts, and Father
has the bonfire all ready, and we'll have a
celebration. A Quicksilver Celebration, eh,
Sue?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom!" said Sue. "Not Quicksilver
any more; just stupid, stupid, grubby lead&mdash;and
rusty, too!"</p>

<p>"Lead doesn't rust," said Teddy, gravely.</p>

<p>"This lead does! And&mdash;I've got something
to read to you all. It is part of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
penance, Mary. Yes, I will! It isn't all
true, but part of it is."</p>

<p>She drew a letter from her pocket (it was
written on pink paper, scented with cheap
scent), and began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Miss Clarice Stephanotis Packard presents her
compliments to Miss Susan Penrose, and tells her
that I am going home to-morrow with my Papa, and
I never shall come to this mean place any more. It
is all my fault for assoshating with my soshal inpheriars,
and if you hadn't have poked your nose
into my afairs, Miss Penrose, and put your old candy
in my pew, I shoud not have been robbed and most
murderd. The girl here says I could have the
law of you to get back the money my mouse ring
cost,&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p>"What girl?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>Sue blushed hotly.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the chambermaid," she said. "She&mdash;Clarice
has made a kind of companion of
her. She isn't a very nice girl, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Then resuming the reading&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"but Papa says he will get me a new one, and I
shall see that nobody gets that away from me. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
never will see me again, Sue, but you will have
those common Harts; I supose they will be glad
enouf to take up with you again.</p>

<p>"So I remain, Miss Penrose,</p>

<p class="left45">"Yours truly,<br />
<span class="i2">"Miss <span class="smcap">Clarice Stephanotis Packard</span>."</span></p>
</div>

<p>Sue's eyes remained fixed on the paper;
her cheeks glowed with shame and mortification;
she could not meet her friends' eyes.
There was a moment of dead silence; then
came a sound that made her look up hastily,
blushing still deeper.</p>

<p>"Why! why, you are all laughing!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"My dear, of course we are laughing!"
cried Mary, catching her in her arms. "What
should we do but laugh? And we <i>are</i> glad to
take up with you again, aren't we, boys?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Tom. "Why, Sue, it's been
only half living without our Quicksilver."</p>

<p>"Have you really missed me?" cried poor
Sue. "Oh, Tom! Of course I know Mary
has, because I know how wretched I have
been, really, all the time, even at first, when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
didn't know it. But you, too, and Teddy?
Oh, I am so glad! so glad! And now there
are five of us, aren't there, Lily?"</p>

<p>Lily answered with a warm caress. She
knew privately that she was the happiest of
the five, but she did not know how to say it.</p>

<p>"Five of us!" echoed Teddy. "I say! we
ought to have a name. The Frisky Five!
No! that isn't good. Somebody else try!"</p>

<p>"The Festive Five!" suggested Tom.</p>

<p>But Mary shook her head. "I have it!"
she said. "Join hands, all! the Faithful Five!
Hurrah for us!"</p>

<p>The five children stood up and held
hands, looking at one another with a certain
solemnity.</p>

<p>"The Faithful Five!" they repeated.
"Hurrah for us!"</p>

<p>And Teddy added: "But we'll make a toast
of it to-night with shrub&mdash;lots of shrub!"</p>

<p>"And now we must make the wigs!" said
Mary. "We'll do that in the barn chamber,
so that we sha'n't mess with the silk."</p>

<p>"And then can't we climb a tree?" said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Sue, plaintively. "I haven't climbed a tree
for a month, Mary! I will be Isabella of
Buchan, if you like, and you can all capture
me and put me in the cage in the greening-tree."</p>

<p>"All right!" "Hurrah!" "Come on!"</p>

<p>The joyous voices died away; and Mrs.
Hart took off her glasses and wiped her eyes,
but not before a tear had fallen on her work.
"Bless them!" she said. "And hurrah for
them! This may have been a good thing,
after all."</p>

<p>An hour later Sue was bending once more
over her journal; but this time Mary's arms
were round her, and Mary's eyes were looking
over her shoulder as she wrote.</p>

<p>"My troubles are over, and they were all
my own fault; but now I am happy, and nothing
but death can part me and Mary. I
have the dearest and best friends in the
world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, Sue!" said Mary.</p>

<p>"I shall!" said Sue, and wrote on:</p>

<p>"And I have told Mamma all about everything,
and she has forgiven me, and now we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
are all different, and she is perfectly lovely,
and we understand all about things together,
like Mary and her mother. And I hope I
am going to be a better girl now all my life;
but still the name I shall always love best is
that I am Mary's own</p>

<p class="left45">'<span class="smcap">Quicksilver Sue</span>.'"</p>
